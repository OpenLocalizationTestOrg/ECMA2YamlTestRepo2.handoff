Controls that derive from the CatalogZoneBase class, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone>, are the controls actually placed on Web pages. They act as containers for other controls, known as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls, that create lists of server controls for users to add to a page.

The mechanism for adding server controls to a catalog is the following set of three controls that derive from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> class.      |Control|Description|   |-------------|-----------------|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PageCatalogPart>|Maintains references to controls that have been closed on a page.

Definition files are XML file with a .WebPart file name extension that import settings for a control. The control must be present on the server before the definition file can be imported.|       The CatalogZoneBase class has a number of properties that are useful for displaying catalogs of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.AddVerb%2A> property references the verb that adds a selected control from the catalog to the page, while the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CloseVerb%2A> property references a verb that closes the catalog and returns the page's display mode to browse mode. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CatalogParts%2A> property references the collection of all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls in the zone. Several text-oriented properties, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.HeaderText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.InstructionText%2A>, override base properties to provide default text appropriate for catalogs. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SelectTargetZoneText%2A> property contains the text alongside the drop-down list control that allows users to choose which zone a control will be added to.       Several other properties are included in the CatalogZoneBase class. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SelectedCatalogPartID%2A> property is a unique string identifier for the currently selected <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.ShowCatalogIcons%2A> property indicates whether to show the icons that can be associated with controls by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A> property on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.PartLinkStyle%2A> property contains style attributes for the links to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls that are not currently selected in the zone. In contrast, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SelectedPartLinkStyle%2A> property contains style attributes for a link to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control that the user has currently selected in the zone.       In addition to the properties, there are also some methods in the CatalogZoneBase class, in addition to the standard event-handling and rendering methods inherited from other base controls, which are uniquely designed for the purpose of handling catalogs of controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CreateCatalogPartChrome%2A> method creates the chrome (peripheral UI elements such as a border, verbs, icons, and a title) that surrounds each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control in the zone, and also handles the rendering for the controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CreateCatalogParts%2A> method is an abstract method; derived classes override it to create instances of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.InvalidateCatalogParts%2A> method can be called by a derived class if the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls in the zone changes for some programmatic reason, and the derived class needs to recreate the collection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.LoadPostData%2A> method loads the previously existing state for the check boxes next to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in the catalog, whenever the page is posted back to the server; conversely, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SaveControlState%2A> method saves the state of the check boxes. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.RenderCatalogPartLinks%2A> method provides all the rendering for the links to each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control contained in the zone.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"The CatalogZoneBase class is a base class that inherits from the &lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone&gt;

Catalogs contain lists of <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart\"></xref> controls that users can add to a Web page.\n  remarks: \"The CatalogZoneBase class is a base class that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class. It provides a base set of behaviors for derived zones.  \\n  \\n The CatalogZoneBase class provides a unique user interface (UI) that enables users to add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and other server controls to Web pages. Controls that derive from the CatalogZoneBase class, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone>, are the controls actually placed on Web pages. They act as containers for other controls, known as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls, that create lists of server controls for users to add to a page. Zones that derive from the CatalogZoneBase class can appear only when the page is in catalog display mode.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  A CatalogZoneBase zone can contain only <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls, and conversely, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls can reside only in CatalogZoneBase zones.  \\n  \\n The mechanism for adding server controls to a catalog is the following set of three controls that derive from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> class.  \\n  \\n|Control|Description|  \\n|-------------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PageCatalogPart>|Maintains references to controls that have been closed on a page. These controls can be reopened (added back to the page) by users.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart>|Contains references to controls that are declared in a Web Parts catalog in the markup of a Web page. These controls can be added to a Web page by users.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ImportCatalogPart>|Provides the UI for a user to upload a definition file to a catalog so that the control can be added to a Web page. Definition files are XML file with a .WebPart file name extension that import settings for a control. The control must be present on the server before the definition file can be imported.|  \\n  \\n The CatalogZoneBase class has a number of properties that are useful for displaying catalogs of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.AddVerb%2A> property references the verb that adds a selected control from the catalog to the page, while the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CloseVerb%2A> property references a verb that closes the catalog and returns the page's display mode to browse mode. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CatalogParts%2A> property references the collection of all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls in the zone. Several text-oriented properties, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.HeaderText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.InstructionText%2A>, override base properties to provide default text appropriate for catalogs. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SelectTargetZoneText%2A> property contains the text alongside the drop-down list control that allows users to choose which zone a control will be added to.  \\n  \\n Several other properties are included in the CatalogZoneBase class. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SelectedCatalogPartID%2A> property is a unique string identifier for the currently selected <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.ShowCatalogIcons%2A> property indicates whether to show the icons that can be associated with controls by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A> property on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.PartLinkStyle%2A> property contains style attributes for the links to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls that are not currently selected in the zone. In contrast, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SelectedPartLinkStyle%2A> property contains style attributes for a link to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control that the user has currently selected in the zone.  \\n  \\n In addition to the properties, there are also some methods in the CatalogZoneBase class, in addition to the standard event-handling and rendering methods inherited from other base controls, which are uniquely designed for the purpose of handling catalogs of controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CreateCatalogPartChrome%2A> method creates the chrome (peripheral UI elements such as a border, verbs, icons, and a title) that surrounds each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control in the zone, and also handles the rendering for the controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.CreateCatalogParts%2A> method is an abstract method; derived classes override it to create instances of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.InvalidateCatalogParts%2A> method can be called by a derived class if the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls in the zone changes for some programmatic reason, and the derived class needs to recreate the collection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.LoadPostData%2A> method loads the previously existing state for the check boxes next to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in the catalog, whenever the page is posted back to the server; conversely, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.SaveControlState%2A> method saves the state of the check boxes. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase.RenderCatalogPartLinks%2A> method provides all the rendering for the links to each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> control contained in the zone.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates several declarative and programmatic uses of the CatalogZoneBase class. Because the class is abstract, the code examples use the derived <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> class that ships with the Web Parts control set, demonstrating the properties and methods that it inherits from the CatalogZoneBase class.  \\n  \\n The code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on the Web page.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that contains a reference to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> control, and some code that demonstrates usage of some key CatalogZoneBase class members.  \\n  \\n-   A custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control that is added to the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> control.  \\n  \\n-   A description of how the example works in a browser.  \\n  \\n The first part of this code example is the user control that enables you to change display modes on the page. For details about display modes and a description of the source code in this control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_CatalogZoneBase_Overview#8](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_157_1.ascx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_CatalogZoneBase_Overview#8](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_157_1.ascx)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example is a Web page that contains a declarative reference to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> control. Near the top of the page are two `Register` directives--one for the user control, and one for the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. Notice that below the `<asp:WebPartZone>` element is an `<asp: CatalogZone>` element that contains declarative references to the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, and to an ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control. The zone also has a variety of tags and properties set to determine its appearance and behavior. Between the `<script>` tags in the page is a variety of event-handling code, most of which demonstrates the various programmatic uses of the CatalogZoneBase members.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_CatalogZoneBase_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_157_2.aspx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_CatalogZoneBase_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_157_2.aspx)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control named `TextDisplayWebPart`. It is declared within the zone, and an end user can add it from the catalog to the page. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a demonstration of both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_CatalogZoneBase_Overview#9](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_157_3.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_CatalogZoneBase_Overview#9](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_157_3.vb)]  \\n  \\n Note that for the code example to work, there is a setting you must add in the Web.config file to enable exporting Web Parts description files. Ensure that you have a Web.config file in the same directory as the Web page for this code example. Within the `<system.web>` section, make sure there is a `<webParts>` element with an `enableExport` attribute set to `true`, as in the following markup.  \\n  \\n `<webParts enableExport=\\\"true\\\">`  \\n  \\n `...`  \\n  \\n `</webParts>`  \\n  \\n When you load the page in a browser, you can select **Catalog** from the drop-down list box to switch to catalog display mode. When the catalog is visible, you can see the two server controls that can be added from the catalog to the page, and you can also note in the UI the effects of the declarative and programmatic uses of the CatalogZoneBase class members.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public abstract class CatalogZoneBase : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone, System.Web.UI.IPostBackDataHandler'\n  inheritance:\n  -
