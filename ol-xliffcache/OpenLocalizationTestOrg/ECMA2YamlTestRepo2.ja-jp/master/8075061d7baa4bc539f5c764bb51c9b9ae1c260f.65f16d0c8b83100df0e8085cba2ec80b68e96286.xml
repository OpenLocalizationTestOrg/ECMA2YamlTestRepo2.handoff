In this example, the callback method is `WaitProc` and the wait handle is an <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent>.  \\n  \\n The example defines a `TaskInfo` class to hold the information that is passed to the callback when it executes. The example creates a `TaskInfo` object and assigns it some string data. The <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle> that is returned by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A> method is assigned to the `Handle` field of the `TaskInfo` object, so that the callback method has access to the <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle>.  \\n  \\n In addition to the `TaskInfo` object, the call to the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A> method specifies the <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent> the task waits on, a WaitOrTimerCallback delegate that represents the `WaitProc` callback method, a one-second timeout interval, and multiple callbacks.  \\n  \\n When the main thread signals the <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent> by calling its <xref:System.Threading.EventWaitHandle.Set%2A> method, the WaitOrTimerCallback delegate is invoked. The `WaitProc` method tests <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle> to determine whether a timeout occurred. If the callback was invoked because the wait handle was signaled, the `WaitProc` method unregisters the <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle>, stopping further callbacks. In the case of a timeout, the task continues waiting. The `WaitProc` method ends by printing a message to the console.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[System.Threading.ThreadPool RegisterWaitForSingleObject0#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.threading.waito_1.cs)]\\n [!code-cpp[System.Threading.ThreadPool RegisterWaitForSingleObject0#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.threading.waito_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.ThreadPool RegisterWaitForSingleObject0#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.threading.waito_1.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public delegate void WaitOrTimerCallback(object state, bool timedOut);\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Delegate\n  platform:\n  - net462\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Delegate\n  isExternal: false\n  name: System.Delegate\n"}
