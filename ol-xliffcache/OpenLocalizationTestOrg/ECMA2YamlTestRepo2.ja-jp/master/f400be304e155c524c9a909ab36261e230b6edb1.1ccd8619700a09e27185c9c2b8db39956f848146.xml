You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).       The Timer component is a server-based timer that raises an <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event in your application after the number of milliseconds in the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property has elapsed. You can configure the Timer object to raise the event just once or repeatedly using the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.AutoReset%2A> property. Typically, a Timer object is declared at the class level so that it stays in scope as long as it is needed. You can then handle its <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event to provide regular processing. For example, suppose you have a critical server that must be kept running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You could create a service that uses a Timer object to periodically check the server and ensure that the system is up and running. If the system is not responding, the service could attempt to restart the server or notify an administrator.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  The Timer class is available in the .NET Framework only. It is not included in the .NET Standard Library and is not available on other platforms, such as .NET Core or the Universal Windows Platform. On these platforms, as well as for portability across all .NET platforms, you should use the <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class instead.       This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.       The server-based Timer class is designed for use with worker threads in a multithreaded environment. Server timers can move among threads to handle the raised <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event, resulting in more accuracy than Windows timers in raising the event on time.       The Timer component raises the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event, based on the value (in milliseconds) of the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property. You can handle this event to perform the processing you need. For example, suppose that you have an online sales application that continuously posts sales orders to a database. The service that compiles the instructions for shipping operates on a batch of orders rather than processing each order individually. You could use a Timer to start the batch processing every 30 minutes.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  The System.Timers.Timer class has the same resolution as the system clock. This means that the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event will fire at an interval defined by the resolution of the system clock if the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property is less than the resolution of the system clock. For more information, see the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property.       When <xref:System.Timers.Timer.AutoReset%2A> is set to `false`, a Timer object raises the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event only once, after the first <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> has elapsed. To keep raising the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event regularly at the interval defined by the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A>, set <xref:System.Timers.Timer.AutoReset%2A> to `true`, which is the default value.       The Timer component catches and suppresses all exceptions thrown by event handlers for the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event. This behavior is subject to change in future releases of the .NET Framework. Note, however, that this is not true of event handlers that execute asynchronously and include the `await` operator (in C#)  or the `Await` operator (in Visual Basic). Exceptions thrown in these event handlers are propagated back to the calling thread, as the following example illustrates. For more information on exceptions thrown in asynchronous methods, see   [Exception Handling](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       [!code-cs[System.Timers.Timer#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.timers.timer_1.cs)]  [!code-vb[System.Timers.Timer#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.timers.timer_1.vb)]       If the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject%2A> property is `null`, the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event is raised on a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread. If processing of the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event lasts longer than <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A>, the event might be raised again on another <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread. In this situation, the event handler should be reentrant.      > [!NOTE] >  The event-handling method might run on one thread at the same time that another thread calls the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Stop%2A> method or sets the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Enabled%2A> property to `false`. This might result in the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event being raised after the timer is stopped. The example code for the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Stop%2A> method shows one way to avoid this race condition.       Even if <xref:System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject%2A> is not `null`, <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> events can occur after the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Dispose%2A> or <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Stop%2A> method has been called or after the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Enabled%2A> property has been set to `false`, because the signal to raise the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event is always queued for execution on a thread pool thread. One way to resolve this race condition is to set a flag that tells the event handler for the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event to ignore subsequent events.       If you use the Timer class with a user interface element, such as a form or control, without placing the timer on that user interface element, assign the form or control that contains the Timer to the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject%2A> property, so that the event is marshaled to the user interface thread.       For a list of default property values for an instance of Timer, see the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.%23ctor%2A> constructor.      > [!TIP] >  Be aware that the .NET Framework Class Library includes four classes named `Timer`, each of which offers different functionality:   >    >  -   Timer (this topic): fires an event at regular intervals.

You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \\n  \\n The Timer component is a server-based timer that raises an <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event in your application after the number of milliseconds in the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property has elapsed. You can configure the Timer object to raise the event just once or repeatedly using the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.AutoReset%2A> property. Typically, a Timer object is declared at the class level so that it stays in scope as long as it is needed. You can then handle its <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event to provide regular processing. For example, suppose you have a critical server that must be kept running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You could create a service that uses a Timer object to periodically check the server and ensure that the system is up and running. If the system is not responding, the service could attempt to restart the server or notify an administrator.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The Timer class is available in the .NET Framework only. It is not included in the .NET Standard Library and is not available on other platforms, such as .NET Core or the Universal Windows Platform. On these platforms, as well as for portability across all .NET platforms, you should use the <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class instead.  \\n  \\n This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n  \\n The server-based Timer class is designed for use with worker threads in a multithreaded environment. Server timers can move among threads to handle the raised <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event, resulting in more accuracy than Windows timers in raising the event on time.  \\n  \\n The Timer component raises the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event, based on the value (in milliseconds) of the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property. You can handle this event to perform the processing you need. For example, suppose that you have an online sales application that continuously posts sales orders to a database. The service that compiles the instructions for shipping operates on a batch of orders rather than processing each order individually. You could use a Timer to start the batch processing every 30 minutes.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The System.Timers.Timer class has the same resolution as the system clock. This means that the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event will fire at an interval defined by the resolution of the system clock if the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property is less than the resolution of the system clock. For more information, see the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property.  \\n  \\n When <xref:System.Timers.Timer.AutoReset%2A> is set to `false`, a Timer object raises the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event only once, after the first <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> has elapsed. To keep raising the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event regularly at the interval defined by the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A>, set <xref:System.Timers.Timer.AutoReset%2A> to `true`, which is the default value.  \\n  \\n The Timer component catches and suppresses all exceptions thrown by event handlers for the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event. This behavior is subject to change in future releases of the .NET Framework. Note, however, that this is not true of event handlers that execute asynchronously and include the `await` operator (in C#)  or the `Await` operator (in Visual Basic). Exceptions thrown in these event handlers are propagated back to the calling thread, as the following example illustrates. For more information on exceptions thrown in asynchronous methods, see   [Exception Handling](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[System.Timers.Timer#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.timers.timer_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Timers.Timer#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.timers.timer_1.vb)]  \\n  \\n If the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject%2A> property is `null`, the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event is raised on a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread. If processing of the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event lasts longer than <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A>, the event might be raised again on another <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread. In this situation, the event handler should be reentrant.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The event-handling method might run on one thread at the same time that another thread calls the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Stop%2A> method or sets the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Enabled%2A> property to `false`. This might result in the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event being raised after the timer is stopped. The example code for the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Stop%2A> method shows one way to avoid this race condition.  \\n  \\n Even if <xref:System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject%2A> is not `null`, <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> events can occur after the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Dispose%2A> or <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Stop%2A> method has been called or after the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Enabled%2A> property has been set to `false`, because the signal to raise the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event is always queued for execution on a thread pool thread. One way to resolve this race condition is to set a flag that tells the event handler for the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Elapsed> event to ignore subsequent events.  \\n  \\n If you use the Timer class with a user interface element, such as a form or control, without placing the timer on that user interface element, assign the form or control that contains the Timer to the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject%2A> property, so that the event is marshaled to the user interface thread.  \\n  \\n For a list of default property values for an instance of Timer, see the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.%23ctor%2A> constructor.  \\n  \\n> [!TIP]\\n>  Be aware that the .NET Framework Class Library includes four classes named `Timer`, each of which offers different functionality:  \\n>   \\n>  -   Timer (this topic): fires an event at regular intervals.

To do this, the <xref:System.Timers.Timer.Interval%2A> property is set to one minute (60,000 milliseconds), and the SynchronizingObject property is set to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> object.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/SynchronizingObjectCS1/Form1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Timers.Timer.SynchronizingObject#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/SynchronizingObjectVB1/Form1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n The example requires that you add the following controls to the form:  \\n  \\n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control named `TextBox1` (its default name).  \\n  \\n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control named `Button1` (its default name).  \\n  \\n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> control named `SaveSaveFileDialog1` (its default name) .\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.ComponentModel.ISynchronizeInvoke SynchronizingObject { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.ComponentModel.ISynchronizeInvoke\n      description: The <xref href=\"System.ComponentModel.ISynchronizeInvoke\"></xref> representing the object used to marshal the event-handler calls that are issued when an interval has elapsed.
