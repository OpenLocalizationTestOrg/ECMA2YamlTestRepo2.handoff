{"nodes":[{"pos":[8431,8564],"content":"Represents a Windows list view control, which displays a collection of items that can be displayed using one of four different views.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Represents a Windows list view control, which displays a collection of items that can be displayed using one of four different views.","pos":[0,133]}]},{"pos":[8577,20746],"content":"A ListView control allows you to display a list of items with item text and, optionally, an icon to identify the type of item. For example, the Windows Explorer list of files is similar in appearance to a ListView control. It displays a list of the files and folders currently selected in the tree. Each file and folder displays an icon associated with it to help identify the type of file or folder. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem> class represents an item within a ListView control. The items that are displayed in the list can be shown in one of five different views. Items can be displayed as large icons, as small icons, or as small icons in a vertical list. Items can also have subitems which contain information that is related to the parent item. The details view allows you to display the item and its subitems in a grid with column headers that identify the information being displayed in a subitem. The tile view, which has limited availability as described below, allows you to display the item and its subitems as a tile that contains a large icon next to the textual information. ListView supports single or multiple selection. The multiple selection feature lets the user select from a list of items in a way similar to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> control. Additionally, the user can activate selected items to perform a task. For example, you could use a ListView control to display a list of files that the application can then open and utilize. The user can select the files to open and then double-click them to activate the items and open the files in the application. The ListView can also display check boxes, using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> property, to allow the user to check the items that they want to perform an action on. You can use the ListView control in a variety of ways. The control can be used to display information from an application, a database, or a text file. The ListView can also be used to obtain information from the user, such as selecting a set of files to process.       ListView provides a large number of properties that provide flexibility in appearance and behavior. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property allows you to change the way in which items are displayed. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LargeImageList%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SmallImageList%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.StateImageList%2A> properties allow you to specify the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> objects that contain the images displayed for items and, in the case of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.StateImageList%2A>, the check boxes that are displayed when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> property is set to `true`. To determine which items are checked, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckedItems%2A> property to access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckedListViewItemCollection> collection. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property allows access to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ColumnHeaderCollection>, which stores the column headers that are displayed when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property of the control is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>. Items are added and removed from the ListView through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> property allows you to access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ListViewItemCollection> of the control, which provides methods for manipulating the items in the control. If you want to allow the user to edit the text of an item, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LabelEdit%2A> property. When your control contains a large number of items, it is often easier for the user to see them in a sorted list. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Sorting%2A> property to sort the items alphabetically. You can also completely customize the appearance of a ListView control. To do this, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.OwnerDraw%2A> property to `true` and handle one or more of the following events: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawSubItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawColumnHeader>.       Many of the properties of the ListView control are used when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property of the control is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AllowColumnReorder%2A> property allows the user of your ListView control to reconfigure the order of columns at run time. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FullRowSelect%2A> property allows an item and its subitems to be selected instead of just the item. To display gridlines in the details view to identify the boundaries of items and subitems in the ListView, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GridLines%2A> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.HeaderStyle%2A> property allows you to specify the type of column headers to display.       A ListView control can operate in virtual mode, where <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem> objects are generated dynamically instead of being stored in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> collection. This can be useful for dealing with very large lists or lists whose contents frequently change. To enable Virtual mode, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.VirtualMode%2A> property to `true` and handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.RetrieveVirtualItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CacheVirtualItems>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SearchForVirtualItem> events.       In addition to the many properties that are available for a ListView control, there are methods and events that your application can use to provide additional capabilities to the ListView. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.BeginUpdate%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.EndUpdate%2A> methods allow you to improve performance when you add many items to a ListView by preventing the control from repainting every time that an item is added. If your ListView control is displaying items and subitems, you may want to provide functionality when the user right-clicks a subitem. To determine the item whose subitem is being clicked, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GetItemAt%2A> method. When performing validation of the items after the user has edited them, you may want to display a specific item to the user to change. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.EnsureVisible%2A> method can be called to ensure that the specific item is in the visible area of the control.       If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LabelEdit%2A> property set to `true`, you can perform tasks such as validating the text being edited before and after the text changed by creating an event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.BeforeLabelEdit> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AfterLabelEdit> events. To perform tasks such as opening a file or displaying a dialog box to edit an item displayed in a ListView, you can create an event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ItemActivate> event. If you allow the user to sort the items in a ListView when they click a column header, you can create an event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ColumnClick> event to perform the sorting. When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> property is set to `true`, you can determine when a change in an item's check state has occurred by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ItemCheck> event.       You can also set a background image for the ListView with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property. Your application must have the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> on its `Main` method to correctly display the background image for the ListView control. In addition, if a ListView control with a background image is hosted in Internet Explorer, specify comctl32.dll version 6.0 as a dependent assembly in the application manifest file to ensure the background image is property displayed.      > [!NOTE] >  Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Cursor%2A> property for a ListView control has no affect on the appearance of the cursor in [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] versions 1.1 and earlier.       Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 provide three features that enhance the ListView control when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method: tile view, grouping, and the insertion mark.       The tile view lets you balance graphical and textual information by displaying item and subitem text next to large icons. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName> to enable this behavior.       The grouping feature lets you visually group items into related categories. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A> property to add <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> objects to the ListView control when you want to enable this feature. To temporarily disable the feature, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ShowGroups%2A> property to `false`.       The insertion mark feature lets you provide drag-and-drop item repositioning with visual feedback to indicate drop locations. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewInsertionMark> object retrieved through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark%2A> property to display the insertion mark.       These features are available only under Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. On earlier operating systems, the code that relate to these features has no effect, the tile view appears as the large icon view, and the insertion mark and groups do not display. In some cases, you might want to include code that determines whether these features are available, and provide alternate functionality when they are unavailable. These features are provided by the same library that provides the operating system themes feature. To check for the availability of this library, call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FeatureSupport.IsPresent%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload and pass in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature.Themes?displayProperty=fullName> value.       The following table shows some of the ListView members and the views they are valid in.      |ListView member|View|   |---------------------|----------|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Alignment%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AutoArrange%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AutoResizeColumn%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawSubItem> event|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FindItemWithText%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FindNearestItem%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GetItemAt%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A> property|All views except <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.HeaderStyle%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|   |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"A ListView control allows you to display a list of items with item text and, optionally, an icon to identify the type of item.","pos":[0,126]},{"content":"For example, the Windows Explorer list of files is similar in appearance to a ListView control.","pos":[127,222]},{"content":"It displays a list of the files and folders currently selected in the tree.","pos":[223,298]},{"content":"Each file and folder displays an icon associated with it to help identify the type of file or folder.","pos":[299,400]},{"content":"The &lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem&gt;

You can create whatever categories you need. One typical approach is to group the items based on the way the list is sorted. For example, you can group the items by the initial letter of the item name when the list is sorted alphabetically or by subitems such as type or date when the list is sorted by clicking a column header in the details view. Windows Explorer uses this type of grouping.       To use the grouping feature, add one or more <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> objects to the Groups collection of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control.

To temporarily disable the grouping feature, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ShowGroups%2A> property to `false`.       You can assign an item to a group by specifying the group in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.%23ctor%2A> constructor, by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.Group%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, or by directly adding the item to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.Items%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection of a group. All items should be assigned to groups before they are displayed. Any items that are not assigned to a group will appear in the default group, which has the header label \"DefaultGroup{0}\". The default group is not contained in the Groups collection, and cannot be altered. It is primarily useful in debugging to ensure that all items have been properly added to groups.       An item can only be in one group at a time. You can change the group to which an item belongs by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.Group%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property at run time or by adding it to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.Items%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection of another group, which automatically removes it from the previous group.       The insertion mark feature is disabled when using groups.

You can set the View property to display each item with large or small icons or display items in a vertical list. The richest option is the details view, which allows you to view not only the items but any subitems specified for each item. Each item is displayed in a grid, with each item listed vertically and the subitems for each item displayed in a column, with column headers. The details view is a perfect way to display database information to a user. With Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, you can also display items as tiles that balance graphical and textual information by showing a large icon along with subitem information of your choosing. To enable tile view, your application must call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The small-image view displays each item with an icon and textual information to the right of the icon. The large-image view displays each item with an icon and textual information below the icon. The size of the icons for the image list is specified by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList.ImageSize%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SmallImageList%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LargeImageList%2A> properties.      > [!NOTE] >  If you are using multiple image lists, for small and large icon view, with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control, you should place small and large versions of the image at the same index location in their respective image lists. When switching between views, the index location of the image in one list is used to locate the image in the other list, regardless of the key value specified.       Most of the properties in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control affect how the different views behave or are displayed. Some properties that affect the views of the items are only useful when the View property is set to a specific value, while others are useful in all views. For example, properties such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GridLines%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FullRowSelect%2A> are only useful when the View property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>, while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.MultiSelect%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> properties are useful in all views.

For example, the View property is often set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName> because the details view provides a number of viewing options not available in the other views.      > [!NOTE] >  If your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control does not have any column headers specified and you set the View property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control will not display any items. If your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control does not have any column headers specified and you set the View property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control will not display any subitems.       The tile view displays each item with a large icon on the left and textual information on the right. The textual information consists of the item label followed by subitems. By default, only the first subitem is displayed, which corresponds to the item label. To display additional subitems, you must add <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColumnHeader> objects to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> collection. Each subitem in the tile corresponds to a column header. To control which subitems are displayed and the order in which they are displayed, you must set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property for each item and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColumnHeader.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property for each header. You can then add, remove, and rearrange headers in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> collection to achieve the desired result.       To control the size of the tiles in the tile view, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.TileSize%2A> property. This is useful to prevent line-wrapping when subitem text is too long for a single line.       For an example of the tile view, see the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.TileSize%2A> property.      > [!NOTE] >  Although columns are only displayed in the details view, subitems without column headers will not display in either the details view or the tile view.       The tile view is available only on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. On earlier operating systems, any code related to the tile view has no effect, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control displays in the large icon view. As a result, any code that depends on the tile view might not work correctly.       You might want to include code that determines whether tile view is available, and provide alternate functionality when it is unavailable. For example, when you use owner drawing to customize the appearance of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> items in the tile view, you might want to use drawing code appropriate to the large icon view when running on operating systems that do not support the tile view.       The tile view feature is provided by the same library that provides the operating system themes feature. To check for the availability of this library, call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FeatureSupport.IsPresent%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload and pass in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature.Themes?displayProperty=fullName> value.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"The View property allows you to specify the type of display the &lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;

csharp\n  name: ListView\n  nameWithType: ListView\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.ListView\n  type: Class\n  summary: Represents a Windows list view control, which displays a collection of items that can be displayed using one of four different views.\n  remarks: \"A ListView control allows you to display a list of items with item text and, optionally, an icon to identify the type of item. For example, the Windows Explorer list of files is similar in appearance to a ListView control. It displays a list of the files and folders currently selected in the tree. Each file and folder displays an icon associated with it to help identify the type of file or folder. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem> class represents an item within a ListView control. The items that are displayed in the list can be shown in one of five different views. Items can be displayed as large icons, as small icons, or as small icons in a vertical list. Items can also have subitems which contain information that is related to the parent item. The details view allows you to display the item and its subitems in a grid with column headers that identify the information being displayed in a subitem. The tile view, which has limited availability as described below, allows you to display the item and its subitems as a tile that contains a large icon next to the textual information. ListView supports single or multiple selection. The multiple selection feature lets the user select from a list of items in a way similar to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> control. Additionally, the user can activate selected items to perform a task. For example, you could use a ListView control to display a list of files that the application can then open and utilize. The user can select the files to open and then double-click them to activate the items and open the files in the application. The ListView can also display check boxes, using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> property, to allow the user to check the items that they want to perform an action on. You can use the ListView control in a variety of ways. The control can be used to display information from an application, a database, or a text file. The ListView can also be used to obtain information from the user, such as selecting a set of files to process.  \\n  \\n ListView provides a large number of properties that provide flexibility in appearance and behavior. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property allows you to change the way in which items are displayed. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LargeImageList%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SmallImageList%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.StateImageList%2A> properties allow you to specify the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> objects that contain the images displayed for items and, in the case of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.StateImageList%2A>, the check boxes that are displayed when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> property is set to `true`. To determine which items are checked, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckedItems%2A> property to access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckedListViewItemCollection> collection. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property allows access to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ColumnHeaderCollection>, which stores the column headers that are displayed when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property of the control is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>. Items are added and removed from the ListView through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> property allows you to access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ListViewItemCollection> of the control, which provides methods for manipulating the items in the control. If you want to allow the user to edit the text of an item, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LabelEdit%2A> property. When your control contains a large number of items, it is often easier for the user to see them in a sorted list. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Sorting%2A> property to sort the items alphabetically. You can also completely customize the appearance of a ListView control. To do this, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.OwnerDraw%2A> property to `true` and handle one or more of the following events: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawSubItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawColumnHeader>.  \\n  \\n Many of the properties of the ListView control are used when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property of the control is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AllowColumnReorder%2A> property allows the user of your ListView control to reconfigure the order of columns at run time. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FullRowSelect%2A> property allows an item and its subitems to be selected instead of just the item. To display gridlines in the details view to identify the boundaries of items and subitems in the ListView, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GridLines%2A> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.HeaderStyle%2A> property allows you to specify the type of column headers to display.  \\n  \\n A ListView control can operate in virtual mode, where <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem> objects are generated dynamically instead of being stored in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> collection. This can be useful for dealing with very large lists or lists whose contents frequently change. To enable Virtual mode, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.VirtualMode%2A> property to `true` and handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.RetrieveVirtualItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CacheVirtualItems>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SearchForVirtualItem> events.  \\n  \\n In addition to the many properties that are available for a ListView control, there are methods and events that your application can use to provide additional capabilities to the ListView. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.BeginUpdate%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.EndUpdate%2A> methods allow you to improve performance when you add many items to a ListView by preventing the control from repainting every time that an item is added. If your ListView control is displaying items and subitems, you may want to provide functionality when the user right-clicks a subitem. To determine the item whose subitem is being clicked, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GetItemAt%2A> method. When performing validation of the items after the user has edited them, you may want to display a specific item to the user to change. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.EnsureVisible%2A> method can be called to ensure that the specific item is in the visible area of the control.  \\n  \\n If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LabelEdit%2A> property set to `true`, you can perform tasks such as validating the text being edited before and after the text changed by creating an event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.BeforeLabelEdit> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AfterLabelEdit> events. To perform tasks such as opening a file or displaying a dialog box to edit an item displayed in a ListView, you can create an event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ItemActivate> event. If you allow the user to sort the items in a ListView when they click a column header, you can create an event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ColumnClick> event to perform the sorting. When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> property is set to `true`, you can determine when a change in an item's check state has occurred by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ItemCheck> event.  \\n  \\n You can also set a background image for the ListView with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property. Your application must have the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> on its `Main` method to correctly display the background image for the ListView control. In addition, if a ListView control with a background image is hosted in Internet Explorer, specify comctl32.dll version 6.0 as a dependent assembly in the application manifest file to ensure the background image is property displayed.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Cursor%2A> property for a ListView control has no affect on the appearance of the cursor in [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] versions 1.1 and earlier.  \\n  \\n Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 provide three features that enhance the ListView control when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method: tile view, grouping, and the insertion mark.  \\n  \\n The tile view lets you balance graphical and textual information by displaying item and subitem text next to large icons. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName> to enable this behavior.  \\n  \\n The grouping feature lets you visually group items into related categories. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A> property to add <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> objects to the ListView control when you want to enable this feature. To temporarily disable the feature, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ShowGroups%2A> property to `false`.  \\n  \\n The insertion mark feature lets you provide drag-and-drop item repositioning with visual feedback to indicate drop locations. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewInsertionMark> object retrieved through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark%2A> property to display the insertion mark.  \\n  \\n These features are available only under Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. On earlier operating systems, the code that relate to these features has no effect, the tile view appears as the large icon view, and the insertion mark and groups do not display. In some cases, you might want to include code that determines whether these features are available, and provide alternate functionality when they are unavailable. These features are provided by the same library that provides the operating system themes feature. To check for the availability of this library, call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FeatureSupport.IsPresent%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload and pass in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature.Themes?displayProperty=fullName> value.  \\n  \\n The following table shows some of the ListView members and the views they are valid in.  \\n  \\n|ListView member|View|  \\n|---------------------|----------|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Alignment%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AutoArrange%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AutoResizeColumn%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawSubItem> event|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FindItemWithText%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FindNearestItem%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GetItemAt%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A> property|All views except <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.HeaderStyle%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example creates a ListView control with three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem> objects specified and three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem> objects specified for each item. The example also creates <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColumnHeader> objects to display the subitems in details view. Two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> objects are also created in the code example to provide images for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem> objects. These <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> objects are added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LargeImageList%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SmallImageList%2A> properties.

Each group consists of a textual header followed by a horizontal line and the items assigned to that group. You can align the header text to the left, right, or center of the control. Any groups assigned to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control appear whenever the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property is set to a value other than <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> groups help your users find the items they are looking for by separating the items into useful categories. You can create whatever categories you need. One typical approach is to group the items based on the way the list is sorted. For example, you can group the items by the initial letter of the item name when the list is sorted alphabetically or by subitems such as type or date when the list is sorted by clicking a column header in the details view. Windows Explorer uses this type of grouping.  \\n  \\n To use the grouping feature, add one or more <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> objects to the Groups collection of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. Set the group header text and header alignment in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.%23ctor%2A> constructor, or set them using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.Header%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.HeaderAlignment%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties.  \\n  \\n To temporarily disable the grouping feature, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.ShowGroups%2A> property to `false`.  \\n  \\n You can assign an item to a group by specifying the group in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.%23ctor%2A> constructor, by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.Group%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, or by directly adding the item to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.Items%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection of a group. All items should be assigned to groups before they are displayed. Any items that are not assigned to a group will appear in the default group, which has the header label \\\"DefaultGroup{0}\\\". The default group is not contained in the Groups collection, and cannot be altered. It is primarily useful in debugging to ensure that all items have been properly added to groups.  \\n  \\n An item can only be in one group at a time. You can change the group to which an item belongs by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.Group%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property at run time or by adding it to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.Items%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection of another group, which automatically removes it from the previous group.  \\n  \\n The insertion mark feature is disabled when using groups. This is because the grouping feature orders items by group membership, while the insertion mark feature is used with drag-and-drop repositioning in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control that does not already order its items.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> groups are available only on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. On earlier operating systems, any code relating to groups has no effect and the groups will not appear.

You can set the View property to display each item with large or small icons or display items in a vertical list. The richest option is the details view, which allows you to view not only the items but any subitems specified for each item. Each item is displayed in a grid, with each item listed vertically and the subitems for each item displayed in a column, with column headers. The details view is a perfect way to display database information to a user. With Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, you can also display items as tiles that balance graphical and textual information by showing a large icon along with subitem information of your choosing. To enable tile view, your application must call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The small-image view displays each item with an icon and textual information to the right of the icon. The large-image view displays each item with an icon and textual information below the icon. The size of the icons for the image list is specified by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList.ImageSize%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SmallImageList%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LargeImageList%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you are using multiple image lists, for small and large icon view, with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control, you should place small and large versions of the image at the same index location in their respective image lists. When switching between views, the index location of the image in one list is used to locate the image in the other list, regardless of the key value specified.  \\n  \\n Most of the properties in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control affect how the different views behave or are displayed. Some properties that affect the views of the items are only useful when the View property is set to a specific value, while others are useful in all views. For example, properties such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GridLines%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FullRowSelect%2A> are only useful when the View property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>, while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.MultiSelect%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A> properties are useful in all views.  \\n  \\n The following table shows some of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> members and the views they are valid in.  \\n  \\n|ListView member|View|  \\n|---------------------|----------|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Alignment%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AutoArrange%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.AutoResizeColumn%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes%2A>|All views except <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.DrawSubItem> event|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FindItemWithText%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.FindNearestItem%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.GetItemAt%2A> method|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A> property|All views except <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.HeaderStyle%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark%2A> property|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>|  \\n  \\n You can use the View property to provide different views of data in your application, or to lock a specific view to utilize that view's benefits. For example, the View property is often set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName> because the details view provides a number of viewing options not available in the other views.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control does not have any column headers specified and you set the View property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control will not display any items. If your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control does not have any column headers specified and you set the View property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control will not display any subitems.  \\n  \\n The tile view displays each item with a large icon on the left and textual information on the right. The textual information consists of the item label followed by subitems. By default, only the first subitem is displayed, which corresponds to the item label. To display additional subitems, you must add <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColumnHeader> objects to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> collection. Each subitem in the tile corresponds to a column header. To control which subitems are displayed and the order in which they are displayed, you must set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property for each item and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColumnHeader.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property for each header. You can then add, remove, and rearrange headers in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> collection to achieve the desired result.  \\n  \\n To control the size of the tiles in the tile view, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.TileSize%2A> property. This is useful to prevent line-wrapping when subitem text is too long for a single line.  \\n  \\n For an example of the tile view, see the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.TileSize%2A> property.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Although columns are only displayed in the details view, subitems without column headers will not display in either the details view or the tile view.  \\n  \\n The tile view is available only on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. On earlier operating systems, any code related to the tile view has no effect, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control displays in the large icon view. As a result, any code that depends on the tile view might not work correctly.  \\n  \\n You might want to include code that determines whether tile view is available, and provide alternate functionality when it is unavailable. For example, when you use owner drawing to customize the appearance of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> items in the tile view, you might want to use drawing code appropriate to the large icon view when running on operating systems that do not support the tile view.  \\n  \\n The tile view feature is provided by the same library that provides the operating system themes feature. To check for the availability of this library, call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FeatureSupport.IsPresent%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload and pass in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature.Themes?displayProperty=fullName> value.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control with three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem> objects specified and three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem> objects specified for each item.
