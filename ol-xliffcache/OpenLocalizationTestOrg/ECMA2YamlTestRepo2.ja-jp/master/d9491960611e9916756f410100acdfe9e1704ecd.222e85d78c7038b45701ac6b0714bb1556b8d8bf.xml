removed, when a selected component changes, and when the current root designer changes.\n  remarks: IDesignerEventService provides notification when a new root designer is created, changed, or disposed. A root designer provides design time support for the base component of a document in designer view. The <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerEventService.SelectionChanged> event provides notification when the current component selection has changed.\n  example:\n  - \"This example demonstrates a designer that uses the IDesignerEventService to display event notifications on a control. To use this example, compile the code to a class library. Add a reference to the library to a new Windows Forms project, and add the control within the library to the **Toolbox**.  Add an instance of the `DesignerMonitor` control to a form in design mode. Right-click the control and click the `Start monitoring` command to display notifications of events raised by the IDesignerEventService.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[IDesignerEventServiceExample#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.componentmodel._105_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-vb[IDesignerEventServiceExample#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.componentmodel._105_1.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public interface IDesignerEventService\n  implements: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerEventService.ActiveDesigner\n  id: ActiveDesigner\n  parent: System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerEventService\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: ActiveDesigner\n  nameWithType: IDesignerEventService.ActiveDesigner\n  fullName: System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerEventService.ActiveDesigner\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  namespace: System.ComponentModel.Design\n  summary: Gets the root designer for the currently active document.\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerHost ActiveDesigner { get;
