Jump Lists are also used in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/add/includes/win7-md.md)] Start menu. You access a Jump List by right-clicking a taskbar button or by clicking the arrow next to a program in the Start menu. For more information about Jump Lists, see the [Taskbar](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178478) section of the Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines.       The JumpList class provides a managed wrapper for the Jump List functionality in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/add/includes/win7-md.md)] taskbar and manages the data passed to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. The functionality exposed by the JumpList class is not available in versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] earlier than [!INCLUDE[win7](~/add/includes/win7-md.md)]. Applications that use the JumpList class will run in other versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], but the Jump List will not be available. For more information about the Windows shell and native Jump List APIs, see [Taskbar Extensions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178479).       The following illustration shows the Jump List for Windows Media Player, with items in the **Tasks** and **Frequent** categories.       ![Windows Media Player Jump List](~/add/media/wpfshell-jumplist.png \"Windows Media Player Jump List\")   Windows Media Player Jump List      ## Configuring a Jump List    Jump Lists can contain two types of items, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath>. A <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> is a link to a program and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is a link to a file. You can visually separate items in a Jump List by creating a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> that does not have a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask.Title%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> specified. This empty <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> will be displayed as a horizontal line in the Jump List.      > [!NOTE] >  If the type of the file specified in a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is not registered with your application, the file will not appear in the Jump List. For example, if you add a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> that points to a .txt file, your application must be registered to handle .txt files. For more information, see [Introduction to File Associations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178480).       Jump items are placed into categories in the JumpList. By default, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem> is displayed in the **Tasks** category. Alternatively, you can specify a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> for the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem>.       You can specify whether the standard **Recent** and **Frequent** categories are displayed in the JumpList by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowRecentCategory%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowFrequentCategory%2A> properties. The contents of these categories are managed by the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. Because these categories might contain much of the same data, you typically display one or the other in your JumpList, but not both. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] automatically manages recent items if they are opened through a common file dialog box or used to open an application through file type association. When an item is accessed through the Jump List, you can notify the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell to add the item to the **Recent** category by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.AddToRecentCategory%2A> method.      ## Applying a Jump List to the Windows Shell    You cannot access the shellâ€™s Jump List directly or read its contents into the JumpList class. Instead, the JumpList class provides a representation of a Jump List that you can work with, and then apply to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. You typically create a JumpList and set it one time when the application is first run. However, you can modify or replace the JumpList at run time.       When you have set the JumpList properties, you must apply the JumpList to the Windows shell before its contents appear in the taskbar Jump List. This is done automatically when the JumpList is first attached to an application, either in XAML or in a call to the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. If you modify the contents of the JumpList at run time, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply its current contents to the Windows shell.      ## Setting a Jump List in XAML    A JumpList is not automatically attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object. You attach a JumpList to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in XAML by using the attached property syntax. The JumpList class implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize> interface to support XAML declaration of a JumpList. If the JumpList is declared in XAML and attached to the current <xref:System.Windows.Application>, it is automatically applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell when the JumpList is initialized.      ## Setting and Modifying a Jump List in Code    You attach a JumpList to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in code by calling the static <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. This also applies the JumpList to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell.       To modify a JumpList at run time, you call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.GetJumpList%2A> method to get the JumpList that is currently attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. After you have modified the properties of the JumpList, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply the changes to the Windows shell.      > [!NOTE] >  You typically create one JumpList that is attached to the <xref:System.Windows.Application> and applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. However, you can create multiple JumpList objects. Only one JumpList at a time can be applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell, and only one JumpList at a time can be associated with an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. The .NET Framework does not require that these be the same JumpList.      > [!NOTE] >  This class contains a link demand at the class level that applies to all members.

Jump Lists are also used in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/add/includes/win7-md.md)] Start menu. You access a Jump List by right-clicking a taskbar button or by clicking the arrow next to a program in the Start menu. For more information about Jump Lists, see the [Taskbar](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178478) section of the Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines.  \\n  \\n The JumpList class provides a managed wrapper for the Jump List functionality in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/add/includes/win7-md.md)] taskbar and manages the data passed to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. The functionality exposed by the JumpList class is not available in versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] earlier than [!INCLUDE[win7](~/add/includes/win7-md.md)]. Applications that use the JumpList class will run in other versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], but the Jump List will not be available. For more information about the Windows shell and native Jump List APIs, see [Taskbar Extensions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178479).  \\n  \\n The following illustration shows the Jump List for Windows Media Player, with items in the **Tasks** and **Frequent** categories.  \\n  \\n ![Windows Media Player Jump List](~/add/media/wpfshell-jumplist.png \\\"Windows Media Player Jump List\\\")  \\nWindows Media Player Jump List  \\n  \\n## Configuring a Jump List  \\n Jump Lists can contain two types of items, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath>. A <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> is a link to a program and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is a link to a file. You can visually separate items in a Jump List by creating a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> that does not have a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask.Title%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> specified. This empty <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> will be displayed as a horizontal line in the Jump List.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If the type of the file specified in a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is not registered with your application, the file will not appear in the Jump List. For example, if you add a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> that points to a .txt file, your application must be registered to handle .txt files. For more information, see [Introduction to File Associations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178480).  \\n  \\n Jump items are placed into categories in the JumpList. By default, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem> is displayed in the **Tasks** category. Alternatively, you can specify a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> for the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem>.  \\n  \\n You can specify whether the standard **Recent** and **Frequent** categories are displayed in the JumpList by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowRecentCategory%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowFrequentCategory%2A> properties. The contents of these categories are managed by the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. Because these categories might contain much of the same data, you typically display one or the other in your JumpList, but not both. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] automatically manages recent items if they are opened through a common file dialog box or used to open an application through file type association. When an item is accessed through the Jump List, you can notify the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell to add the item to the **Recent** category by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.AddToRecentCategory%2A> method.  \\n  \\n## Applying a Jump List to the Windows Shell  \\n You cannot access the shellâ€™s Jump List directly or read its contents into the JumpList class. Instead, the JumpList class provides a representation of a Jump List that you can work with, and then apply to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. You typically create a JumpList and set it one time when the application is first run. However, you can modify or replace the JumpList at run time.  \\n  \\n When you have set the JumpList properties, you must apply the JumpList to the Windows shell before its contents appear in the taskbar Jump List. This is done automatically when the JumpList is first attached to an application, either in XAML or in a call to the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. If you modify the contents of the JumpList at run time, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply its current contents to the Windows shell.  \\n  \\n## Setting a Jump List in XAML  \\n A JumpList is not automatically attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object. You attach a JumpList to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in XAML by using the attached property syntax. The JumpList class implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize> interface to support XAML declaration of a JumpList. If the JumpList is declared in XAML and attached to the current <xref:System.Windows.Application>, it is automatically applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell when the JumpList is initialized.  \\n  \\n## Setting and Modifying a Jump List in Code  \\n You attach a JumpList to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in code by calling the static <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. This also applies the JumpList to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell.  \\n  \\n To modify a JumpList at run time, you call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.GetJumpList%2A> method to get the JumpList that is currently attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. After you have modified the properties of the JumpList, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply the changes to the Windows shell.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You typically create one JumpList that is attached to the <xref:System.Windows.Application> and applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. However, you can create multiple JumpList objects. Only one JumpList at a time can be applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell, and only one JumpList at a time can be associated with an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. The .NET Framework does not require that these be the same JumpList.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  This class contains a link demand at the class level that applies to all members. A <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when the immediate caller does not have full-trust permission.
