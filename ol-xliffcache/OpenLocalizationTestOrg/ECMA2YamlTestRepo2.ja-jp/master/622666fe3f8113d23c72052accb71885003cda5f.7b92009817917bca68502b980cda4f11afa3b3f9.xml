Many controls implement behavior where a certain event is marked as handled, and is replaced by another more intuitive event. Generally, a control will only mark a platform input event as handled if there is some design intention for doing so. In certain scenarios, those design intentions might not be what your particular handling of the input event requires. It is for these scenarios that registering handlers with `handledEventsToo` as `true` is appropriate. But you should not do this routinely. Invoking handlers in response to all events even if handled will complicate your own application event processing logic. You may see a decrease in performance if the handler logic is substantial. You should reserve the use of attaching handlers for already-handled events for situations where you have already discovered during the development process that certain controls are handling events that you still want to handle with application logic.       Another technique for avoiding the class handling behavior of certain event-control combinations is to use that event's preview alternative.

Your <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation is called internally by Arrange as part of default WPF framework-level layout operations. However, this assumes you are using WPF framework-level layout and its layout system, which is often not the case if you are specifically deriving elements at the WPF core-level from the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> base element class. Your <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation should also call Arrange on each child element, if it has child elements.

Computation of WPF framework-level layout positioning in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] consists of a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call and an Arrange call. During the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call, the layout system determines an element's size requirements using a provided <xref:System.Windows.Size> (`availableSize`) argument. During the Arrange call, the layout system finalizes the size and position of an element's bounding box.  For more information, see [Layout](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       `availableSize` can be any number from zero to infinity. Elements to be laid out return the minimum <xref:System.Windows.Size> they require through the `availableSize` parameter.       When a layout is first instantiated, it always receives a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call before Arrange. However, after the first layout pass, it may receive an Arrange call without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>; this can happen when a property that affects only Arrange is changed (such as alignment), or when the parent receives an Arrange without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>. A <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call will automatically invalidate an Arrange call.       Layout updates generally occur asynchronously (at a time determined by the layout system). An element might not immediately reflect changes to properties that affect element sizing (such as <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A>).      > [!NOTE] >  Layout updates can be forced by using the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> method; however, calling this function is not recommended, as it is usually unnecessary and can cause poor performance. In many situations where calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> might be appropriate, the layout system will probably already be processing updates. The layout system can process layout changes in a manner that can optimize all necessary updates as part of a package.       The layout system keeps two separate queues of invalid layouts, one for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> and one for Arrange. The layout queue is sorted based upon the order of elements in the visual tree. Elements higher in the tree are at the top of the queue, in order to avoid redundant layouts caused by repeated changes in parents. Duplicate entries are automatically removed from the queue, and elements are automatically removed from the queue if they are already valid.       When updating layout, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> queue is emptied first, followed by the Arrange queue. An element in the Arrange queue will never be arranged if there is an element in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> queue.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"For WPF framework-level element deriving scenarios, behavior for Arrange should not (and cannot, unless you shadow) be changed.","pos":[0,127]},{"content":"Instead, you should override the &lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A&gt;

If that event is marked as handled along the event route, the mouse-button specific events are still raised; however, handlers of the mouse-button specific events must be added by explicitly calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A>, with the option to handle events that are already marked as handled, in order to be listeners to the event. If you mark MouseRightButtonUp handled, you are essentially marking <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> handled for all further listeners along the route, and on all related events.       Conceptually, think of this event (and other mouse-button events on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>) to be a mouse \"service\" (with the service definition provided by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class). The event adds the convenience of not needing to check the mouse button states (left-right, up-down) of the original mouse events in the event data. For more advanced scenarios, such as checking for states of non-standard buttons, you might need to use the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] on the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class rather than those on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.      <a name=\"routedEventInfo_MouseRightButtonUp\"></a>    ## Routed Event Information      |||   |-|-|   |Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseRightButtonUpEvent>|   |Routing strategy|Direct|   |Delegate|<xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventHandler>|      -   Override <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseRightButtonUp%2A> to implement class handling for this event in derived classes.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Although this  seems to follow a bubbling route through an element tree, it actually is a direct routed event that is raised and reraised along the element tree by each &lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement&gt;.","pos":[0,201],"source":"Although this  seems to follow a bubbling route through an element tree, it actually is a direct routed event that is raised and reraised along the element tree by each <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>."},{"content":"This event is one of several related events that report the mouse-button specifics of an underlying &lt;xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseUp?displayProperty=fullName&gt;

Although you can mark the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> event as handled for purposes of this element, the handled state does not perpetuate to other elements along the event route. However, you might want to mark the event as handled in order to prevent general instance handlers (those that did not specify `handledEventsToo`) from being invoked.       The default implementation for general mouse event handling in <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> listens for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> and converts it to an appropriate local event. If you want to override this logic, you must create a derived class. In the static constructor of your derived class, register an alternative class handler for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName>. You cannot change the mouse handling behavior of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> by overriding OnMouseLeftButtonDown.

For instance, if a list has a 50% (0.5) opacity and one of its list items has its own opacity set to 20% (0.2), the net visible opacity for that list item will be rendered as if it were 10% (0.1), but the property value of the list item Opacity property would still be 0.2 when queried.       Even if the declared or evaluated opacity is 0, an element still participates in input events and commands, and is potentially focusable. This aspect can be useful, for instance you can use an opacity-zero object (such as a shape) for masking underlying objects with transparent elements. The opacity-zero object can then handle all the input event processing for an underlying area. However, the `Background` or `Fill` of the object or shape should be set to a value, even if it is <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brushes.Transparent%2A>, otherwise hit testing is not enabled, and no events are received.      <a name=\"dependencyPropertyInfo_Opacity\"></a>    ## Dependency Property Information      |||   |-|-|   |Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OpacityProperty>|   |Metadata properties set to `true`|None|","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"The 1.0 default value is the default provided by the initial metadata of this dependency property on the &lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement&gt; class.","pos":[0,143],"source":"The 1.0 default value is the default provided by the initial metadata of this dependency property on the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> class."},{"content":"Other derived classes may potentially change this default value by overriding the metadata from within their class constructor.","pos":[144,271]},{"content":"The value of Opacity won't be applied to actual layout unless the element is also visible (&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible%2A&gt; is <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph>).","pos":[278,425],"source":"       The value of Opacity won't be applied to actual layout unless the element is also visible (<xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible%2A> is `true`)."},{"content":"Opacity is applied from parent elements on down the element tree to child elements, but the visible effects of the nested opacity settings aren't indicated in the property value of individual child elements.","pos":[432,639]},{"content":"For instance, if a list has a 50% (0.5) opacity and one of its list items has its own opacity set to 20% (0.2), the net visible opacity for that list item will be rendered as if it were 10% (0.1), but the property value of the list item Opacity property would still be 0.2 when queried.","pos":[640,926]},{"content":"Even if the declared or evaluated opacity is 0, an element still participates in input events and commands, and is potentially focusable.","pos":[933,1070]},{"content":"This aspect can be useful, for instance you can use an opacity-zero object (such as a shape) for masking underlying objects with transparent elements.","pos":[1071,1221]},{"content":"The opacity-zero object can then handle all the input event processing for an underlying area.","pos":[1222,1316]},{"content":"However, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Background`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`Fill`</ph> of the object or shape should be set to a value, even if it is &lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Brushes.Transparent%2A&gt;, otherwise hit testing is not enabled, and no events are received.","pos":[1317,1533],"source":" However, the `Background` or `Fill` of the object or shape should be set to a value, even if it is <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brushes.Transparent%2A>, otherwise hit testing is not enabled, and no events are received."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">&lt;a name=\"dependencyPropertyInfo_Opacity\"&gt;</bpt><ept id=\"p1\">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>    ## Dependency Property Information      |||   |-|-|   |Identifier field|&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OpacityProperty&gt;|   |Metadata properties set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph>|None|","pos":[1539,1751],"source":"<a name=\"dependencyPropertyInfo_Opacity\"></a>    ## Dependency Property Information      |||   |-|-|   |Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OpacityProperty>|   |Metadata properties set to `true`|None|"}]},{"pos":[518994,519078],"content":"The opacity factor.

If that event is marked as handled along the event route, the mouse-button specific events are still raised; however, handlers of the mouse-button specific events must be added by explicitly calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A>, with the option to handle events that are already marked as handled, in order to be listeners to the event. If you mark PreviewMouseRightButtonDown handled, you are essentially marking <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> handled for all further listeners along the route, and on all related events. This possibly includes class-handler generated events such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.PreviewMouseDoubleClick>.       Conceptually, think of this event (and other mouse-button events on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>) to be a mouse \"service\" (with the service definition provided by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class).

This includes the events for keyboard, mouse and stylus input, and related status properties. Many of these events are routed events, and many of the input-related events have both a bubbling routing version as well as a tunneling version of the event. These paired events are typically the events of greatest interest to control authors.  \\n  \\n UIElement also includes [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] that relate to the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] event model, including methods that can raise specified routed events that are sourced from an element instance.  \\n  \\n In terms of architecture, UIElement can be considered roughly equivalent to a window handle in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win32](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-win32-md.md)] programming, or an Element in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_dhtml](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-dhtml-md.md)] programming. UIElement is a base element at the WPF core level.  \\n  \\n A UIElement has the following capabilities that are specifically defined by the UIElement class:  \\n  \\n-   Can render as a child element (UIElement derives from <xref:System.Windows.Media.Visual>, a high level graphics class)  \\n  \\n-   Contains logic that is used to size and position possible child elements of a UIElement (when interpreted by a layout system)  \\n  \\n-   Can respond to user input (including control of where input is getting sent to via their handling of event routing, or routing of commands)  \\n  \\n-   Can raise routed events that travel a route through the logical element tree  \\n  \\n-   Supports some aspects of the animation system  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> is the WPF framework-level implementation class that builds on UIElement, and adds specific interactions with the WPF framework level. <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> adds and defines the following capabilities:  \\n  \\n-   Additional framework-specific layout characteristics  \\n  \\n-   Support for richer metadata reporting on properties  \\n  \\n-   Class-specific implementation of certain input base classes and their attached properties or attached events  \\n  \\n-   Style support  \\n  \\n-   Further animation support  \\n  \\n Another related class is <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement>. The <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> class implements many of the same members as does UIElement; the difference between these two classes has to do with their intended place in the overall content model. A UIElement derived class typically defines a relatively rigid content model, meaning that there are restrictions on what elements may be child elements in markup. There might be capacity for taking less restrictive child content in a UIElement, but that capacity is typically centralized in designated content properties. A <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> derived class is typically not as restrictive about content, to support scenarios such as flow-format documents.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Visibility%2A> state affects all input handling by that element.

Specify <code>handledEventsToo</code> as <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_true\" name=\"true\" href=\"\"></xref> to have the provided handler be invoked for routed event that had already been marked as handled by another element along the event route.\n  remarks: \"Processing low-level input events in a practical way is a complex task. Many controls implement behavior where a certain event is marked as handled, and is replaced by another more intuitive event. Generally, a control will only mark a platform input event as handled if there is some design intention for doing so. In certain scenarios, those design intentions might not be what your particular handling of the input event requires. It is for these scenarios that registering handlers with `handledEventsToo` as `true` is appropriate. But you should not do this routinely. Invoking handlers in response to all events even if handled will complicate your own application event processing logic. You may see a decrease in performance if the handler logic is substantial. You should reserve the use of attaching handlers for already-handled events for situations where you have already discovered during the development process that certain controls are handling events that you still want to handle with application logic.  \\n  \\n Another technique for avoiding the class handling behavior of certain event-control combinations is to use that event's preview alternative. For example, if <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> is marked handled by class handling, you might be able to add handlers for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> instead.  \\n  \\n You can add the same handler for the same event multiple times without raising an exception.

Instead, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A> implementation in your class. Your <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A> implementation is called internally by Arrange as part of default WPF framework-level layout operations.

Instead, you should override <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> in your class. Your <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation is called internally by Arrange as part of default WPF framework-level layout operations. However, this assumes you are using WPF framework-level layout and its layout system, which is often not the case if you are specifically deriving elements at the WPF core-level from the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> base element class. Your <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation should also call Arrange on each child element, if it has child elements. Note that the WPF core-level scenario implies that you are not using a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> derived class, because <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeCore%2A>.  \\n  \\n Computation of WPF framework-level layout positioning in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] consists of a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call and an Arrange call. During the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call, the layout system determines an element's size requirements using a provided <xref:System.Windows.Size> (`availableSize`) argument. During the Arrange call, the layout system finalizes the size and position of an element's bounding box.  For more information, see [Layout](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n `availableSize` can be any number from zero to infinity. Elements to be laid out return the minimum <xref:System.Windows.Size> they require through the `availableSize` parameter.  \\n  \\n When a layout is first instantiated, it always receives a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call before Arrange. However, after the first layout pass, it may receive an Arrange call without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>; this can happen when a property that affects only Arrange is changed (such as alignment), or when the parent receives an Arrange without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>. A <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call will automatically invalidate an Arrange call.  \\n  \\n Layout updates generally occur asynchronously (at a time determined by the layout system). An element might not immediately reflect changes to properties that affect element sizing (such as <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A>).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Layout updates can be forced by using the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> method; however, calling this function is not recommended, as it is usually unnecessary and can cause poor performance. In many situations where calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> might be appropriate, the layout system will probably already be processing updates. The layout system can process layout changes in a manner that can optimize all necessary updates as part of a package.  \\n  \\n The layout system keeps two separate queues of invalid layouts, one for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> and one for Arrange. The layout queue is sorted based upon the order of elements in the visual tree. Elements higher in the tree are at the top of the queue, in order to avoid redundant layouts caused by repeated changes in parents. Duplicate entries are automatically removed from the queue, and elements are automatically removed from the queue if they are already valid.  \\n  \\n When updating layout, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> queue is emptied first, followed by the Arrange queue.

The left mouse button down event is the most likely event to have class handling in a control. The class handling often marks the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class event as handled. Once the event is marked handled, other instance handlers that are attached to that element are not ordinarily raised. Any other class or instance handlers that are attached to elements in the bubbling direction towards the root in the UI tree are also not ordinarily raised.  \\n  \\n You can resolve the issue that is outlined in the preceding Important and still receive MouseLeftButtonDown events for left mouse button down events on a derived class that has class handling by using either of these solutions:  \\n  \\n-   Attach handlers for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseDown> event, which is not marked as handled by the controls. Notice that because this is a preview event, the route starts at the root and tunnels down to the control.  \\n  \\n-   Register a handler on the control procedurally by calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A> and choosing the signature option that enables handlers to listen for events even if they are already marked as handled in the routed event data.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"routedEventInfo_MouseLeftButtonDown\\\"></a>   \\n## Routed Event Information  \\n  \\n|||  \\n|-|-|  \\n|Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDownEvent>|  \\n|Routing strategy|Direct|  \\n|Delegate|<xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventHandler>|  \\n  \\n-   Override <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseLeftButtonDown%2A> to implement class handling for this event in derived classes.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public event System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventHandler MouseLeftButtonDown;\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventHandler\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDownEvent\n  id: MouseLeftButtonDownEvent\n  parent: System.Windows.UIElement\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: MouseLeftButtonDownEvent\n  nameWithType: UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDownEvent\n  fullName: System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDownEvent\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationCore\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Identifies the <xref href=\"System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown\"></xref> routed event.\n  remarks: \"Routed event identifiers are created when routed events are registered.

See Remark below.  \\n  \\n The TextInput event may already be marked as handled by the internal implementations of composited controls. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> is a composited control where the TextInput event is already marked as handled; within its compositing. Controls do this because the control needs to interpret some types of input, such as arrow keys, as having special meaning to that control. If you use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTextInput> as the event where you attach handlers for text input, you may receive better results. This technique circumvents most cases where control composition has already marked this event as handled and prevents your handler from receiving the event along the event route.  \\n  \\n The TextInput event allows a component or application to listen for text input in a device-independent manner. The keyboard is the primary means of TextInput, but speech, handwriting, and other input devices can also raise TextInput.  \\n  \\n Because of key combinations—either in default keyboards or through input method editors—multiple key events might raise just one text input event.  \\n  \\n This event creates an alias for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TextCompositionManager.TextInput?displayProperty=fullName> attached event for this class, so that TextInput is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element.
