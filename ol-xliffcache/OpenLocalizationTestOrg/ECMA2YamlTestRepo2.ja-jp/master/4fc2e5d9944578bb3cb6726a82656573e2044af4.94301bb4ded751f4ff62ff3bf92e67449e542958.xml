Therefore it only indicates that a click has occurred. If you need more specific mouse information (button, number of clicks, wheel rotation, or location), use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseClick> event. However, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseClick> event will not be raised if the click is caused by action other than that of the mouse, such as pressing the ENTER key.       A double-click is determined by the mouse settings of the user's operating system. The user can set the time between clicks of a mouse button that should be considered a double-click instead of two clicks. The `Click` event is raised every time that a control is double-clicked. For example, if you have event handlers for the `Click` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> events of a [control](ms-help://MS.VSCC.v90/MS.MSDNQTR.v90.en/fxref_system.windows.forms/html/6569d671-0a28-7b3f-dbb8-90c3d272b6e2.htm), the `Click` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> events are raised when the control is double-clicked and both methods are called. If a control is double-clicked and that control does not support the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> event, the `Click` event might be raised two times.
