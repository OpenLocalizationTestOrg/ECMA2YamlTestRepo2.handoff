To learn how to create custom dependency properties, see [Custom Dependency Properties](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       An attached property is a property that enables any object to report information to the type that defines the attached property. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], any type that inherits from <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> can use an attached property regardless of whether the type inherits from the type that defines the property. An attached property is a feature of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] language.  To set an attached property in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], use the *ownerType*.*propertyName* syntax. An example of an attached property is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. If you want to create a property that can be used on all <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> types, then you should create an attached property.

Typically, AddOwner is used to add dependency properties to classes that do not already expose that dependency property through managed class inheritance (class inheritance would cause the wrapper properties to be inherited by the derived class, and thus would provide general members-table access to the dependency property already). AddOwner enables the property system to recognize a dependency property on a type that did not register that dependency property initially.

The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> methodology recommended above is used when creating [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] declared within [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For instance, both <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> define a `BorderBrush` dependency property, which have similar functionality. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> defines its `BorderBrush` property to the property system by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> on original owner <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and its registered <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border.BorderBrushProperty> dependency property identifer. The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> return value is then used to establish a static <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> field (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderBrushProperty>)for that property on the added owner, and a `BorderBrush` property wrapper is also declared.       The added owner's dependency property identifier should be used for operations such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A>. However, type-specific operations involving either types or instances of the class that was added as owner with different metadata will still return the expected results even if the original (not the added owner's) dependency property identifier is specified in calls to methods such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.GetMetadata%2A>. The metadata for the added owner is perpetuated by the AddOwner call itself, not necessarily referenced exclusively by the adding owner class identifier field. Nevertheless, it is good practice to expose the  identifier, as well as new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using AddOwner, because failing to do so creates disparity between the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] representations of your properties.       The supplied metadata is merged with the property metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the base owner. Any characteristics that were specified in the original base metadata will persist. Only those characteristics that were specifically changed in the new metadata will override the characteristics of the base metadata. Some characteristics, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A>, are replaced if they are specified in the new metadata. Others, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback>, are combined. Ultimately, the merge behavior depends on the property metadata type being used for the override, so the behavior described here is for the existing property metadata classes used by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] dependency properties.

For more information, see [Styling and Templating](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n-   The property can be set through data binding. For more information about data binding dependency properties, see [How to: Bind the Properties of Two Controls](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n-   The property can be set with a dynamic resource reference. For more information, see [XAML Resources](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n-   The property can inherit its value automatically from a parent element in the element tree. For more information, see [Property Value Inheritance](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n-   The property can be animated. For more information, see [Animation Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n-   The property can report when the previous value of the property has been changed and the property value can be coerced.

An attached property is a feature of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] language.  To set an attached property in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], use the *ownerType*.*propertyName* syntax. An example of an attached property is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. If you want to create a property that can be used on all <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> types, then you should create an attached property.

This can be preceded by an XML namespace prefix if the property is not in the default XML namespace (for details, see [XAML Namespaces and Namespace Mapping for WPF XAML](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).)  \\n  \\n `ownerType`.`dependencyPropertyName`  \\n A string that specifies an owner type of a dependency property, a dot (.), then the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. `ownerType` can also be preceded by an XML namespace prefix. This usage is particular to late-bound styles and templates, where the owner of the dependency property must be specified for parsing context because the `TargetType` is not yet known. For more information, see [Styling and Templating](../Topic/Styling%20and%20Templating.md).  \\n  \\n `attachedPropertyOwnerType` *.* `attachedPropertyName`  \\n A string that specifies  the owner of an attached property, a dot (.), then the attached property name. `attachedPropertyOwnerType` can also be preceded by an XML namespace prefix.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter(\"System.Windows.Markup.DependencyPropertyConverter, PresentationFramework, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35, Custom=null\")]\n\n      [System.Windows.Markup.ValueSerializer(typeof(System.Windows.DependencyPropertyValueSerializer))]\n\n      public sealed class DependencyProperty\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner(System.Type)\n  id: AddOwner(System.Type)\n  parent: System.Windows.DependencyProperty\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AddOwner(Type)\n  nameWithType: DependencyProperty.AddOwner(Type)\n  fullName: System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner(Type)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - WindowsBase\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Adds another type as an owner of a dependency property that has already been registered.\n  remarks: \"This method enables the property system to recognize a dependency property on a type that did not register that particular dependency property initially.  \\n  \\n Typically, AddOwner is used to add dependency properties to classes that do not already expose that dependency property through managed class inheritance (class inheritance would cause the wrapper properties to be inherited by the derived class, and thus would provide general members-table access to the dependency property already). AddOwner enables the property system to recognize a dependency property on a type that did not register that dependency property initially.  \\n  \\n This signature does not allow for specifying metadata.  When you use this method, the metadata is automatically generated for the new <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> and its owner type. The auto-generated metadata is the result of the merged metadata from all of the base types that have this property defined. If no merged metadata is available, then the default metadata for the property is used. If the property is registered by using the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> method, then the default metadata is the same as the metadata that is created when <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> was called. Otherwise, the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata> object is created with the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A> property set to the property type's default and all other properties of the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata> is set to `null`. Use the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.PropertyMetadata%29> signature if you want to provide metadata for the version of the dependency property as added to the provided type.  \\n  \\n The return value of this method is typically used to declare and expose the dependency property by storing a dependency property identifier. The identifier provides access to the dependency property if you want to call property system [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] against the dependency property, particularly as it exists on the adding owner class. The same property name for both original owner and added owner should be used to indicate the similar functionality. You should use the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> return value of the AddOwner method to define the dependency property identifier, and also to declare [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using AddOwner.  \\n  \\n The AddOwner methodology recommended above is used when creating the dependency properties that are declared within [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For instance, both <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> define a `BorderBrush` dependency property, which have similar functionality. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> defines its `BorderBrush` property to the property system by calling AddOwner based on the original owner <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and its registered <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border.BorderBrushProperty> dependency property identifer. The AddOwner return value is then used to establish a new static <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> field (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderBrushProperty>) for that property on the added owner, and a `BorderBrush` property wrapper is also declared.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.Windows.DependencyProperty AddOwner (Type ownerType);\n    parameters:\n    - id: ownerType\n      type: System.Type\n      description: The type to add as an owner of this dependency property.\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.DependencyProperty\n      description: A reference to the original <xref href=\"System.Windows.DependencyProperty\"></xref> identifier that identifies the dependency property.

Generally, the same property name for both original owner and added owner should be used to indicate the similar functionality. It is good practice to expose the identifiers, as well as new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A>.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> methodology recommended above is used when creating [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] declared within [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For instance, both <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> define a `BorderBrush` dependency property, which have similar functionality. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> defines its `BorderBrush` property to the property system by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> on original owner <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and its registered <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border.BorderBrushProperty> dependency property identifer. The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> return value is then used to establish a static <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> field (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderBrushProperty>)for that property on the added owner, and a `BorderBrush` property wrapper is also declared.  \\n  \\n The added owner's dependency property identifier should be used for operations such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A>. However, type-specific operations involving either types or instances of the class that was added as owner with different metadata will still return the expected results even if the original (not the added owner's) dependency property identifier is specified in calls to methods such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.GetMetadata%2A>. The metadata for the added owner is perpetuated by the AddOwner call itself, not necessarily referenced exclusively by the adding owner class identifier field. Nevertheless, it is good practice to expose the  identifier, as well as new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using AddOwner, because failing to do so creates disparity between the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] representations of your properties.  \\n  \\n The supplied metadata is merged with the property metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the base owner. Any characteristics that were specified in the original base metadata will persist. Only those characteristics that were specifically changed in the new metadata will override the characteristics of the base metadata. Some characteristics, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A>, are replaced if they are specified in the new metadata. Others, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback>, are combined. Ultimately, the merge behavior depends on the property metadata type being used for the override, so the behavior described here is for the existing property metadata classes used by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] dependency properties.
