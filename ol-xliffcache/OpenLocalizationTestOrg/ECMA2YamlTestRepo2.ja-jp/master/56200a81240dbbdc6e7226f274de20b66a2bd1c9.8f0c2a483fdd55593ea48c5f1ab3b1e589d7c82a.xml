Instead, confidence scores provide a mechanism for comparing the relative accuracy of multiple recognition alternates for a given input. This facilitates returning the most accurate recognition result. For example, if a recognized phrase has a confidence score of 0.8, this does not mean that the phrase has an 80% chance of being the correct match for the input.  It means that the phrase is more likely to be the correct match for the input than other results that have confidence scores less than 0.8.  \\n  \\n A confidence score on its own is not meaningful unless you have alternative results to compare against, either from the same recognition operation or from previous recognitions of the same input. The values are used to rank alternative candidate phrases returned by the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult.Alternates%2A> property on <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult> objects.  \\n  \\n Confidence values are relative and unique to each recognition engine. Confidence values returned by two different recognition engines cannot be meaningfully compared.  \\n  \\n A speech recognition engine may assign a low confidence score to spoken input for various reasons, including background interference, inarticulate speech, or unanticipated words or word sequences. If your application is using a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> instance, you can modify the confidence level at which speech input is accepted or rejected with one of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.UpdateRecognizerSetting%2A> methods. Confidence thresholds for the shared recognizer, managed by <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer>, are associated with a user profile and stored in the Windows registry. Applications should not write changes to the registry for the properties of the shared recognizer.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult.Alternates%2A> property of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult> object contains an ordered collection of <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognizedPhrase> objects, each of which is a possible match for the input to the recognizer.
