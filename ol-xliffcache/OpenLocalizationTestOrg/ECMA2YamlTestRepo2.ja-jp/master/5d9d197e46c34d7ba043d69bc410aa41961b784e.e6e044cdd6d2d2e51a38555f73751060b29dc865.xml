The code uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawMode%2A> property to specify that the items drawn are fixed sized and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawItem> event to perform the drawing of each item into the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>. The example code uses the properties and methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawItemEventArgs> class passed as a parameter to the event handler to draw the items. This example assumes that a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> control called `listBox1` has been added to a form and that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawItem> event is handled by the event handler defined in the example code. The example also assumes that items have been added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> with the text of \\\"Apple\\\", \\\"Orange\\\", and \\\"Plum\\\" in that order.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[ListBox.DrawMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.d_81_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[ListBox.DrawMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.d_81_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public enum DrawMode\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.Normal\n  id: Normal\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Normal\n  nameWithType: DrawMode.Normal\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.Normal\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: All the elements in a control are drawn by the operating system and are of the same size.\n  syntax:\n    content: Normal\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed\n  id: OwnerDrawFixed\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OwnerDrawFixed\n  nameWithType: DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: All the elements in the control are drawn manually and are of the same size.\n  syntax:\n    content: OwnerDrawFixed\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawVariable\n  id: OwnerDrawVariable\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OwnerDrawVariable\n  nameWithType: DrawMode.OwnerDrawVariable\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawVariable\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: All the elements in the control are drawn manually and can differ in size.\n  syntax:\n    content: OwnerDrawVariable\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Enum\n  isExternal: false\n  name: System.Enum\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.Normal\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Normal\n  nameWithType: DrawMode.Normal\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.Normal\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms\n  isExternal: false\n  name: DrawMode\n  nameWithType: DrawMode\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: OwnerDrawFixed\n  nameWithType: DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawVariable\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: OwnerDrawVariable\n  nameWithType: DrawMode.OwnerDrawVariable\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.OwnerDrawVariable\n"}
