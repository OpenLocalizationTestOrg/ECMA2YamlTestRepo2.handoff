The <xref:System.Web.Management> namespace contains the health-event types responsible for packaging application health-status data and the provider types responsible for processing this data. It also contains supporting types that help during the management of health events.       Application lifetime events include events such as application startup and shutdown events. If an application is terminated, you can determine why by viewing the related event message field.       When a WebApplicationLifetimeEvent instance occurs, ASP.NET health monitoring updates the Application Lifetime Events performance counter. You can log these events by adding the WebApplicationLifetimeEvent object to the `rules` subsection of the `healthMonitoring` section of the configuration file, as shown in the following example.      ```   <rules>     <add name=\"Application Events\"       eventName=\"Application Lifetime Events\"       provider=\"EventLogProvider\"       profile=\"Default\"       minInterval=\"00:01:00\" />   </rules>      ```       The Application Lifetime Events performance counter contains the sum total of all ASP.NET lifetime events. To view this performance counter in System Monitor (PerfMon), in the **Add Counters** window select **ASP.NET** from the **Performance object** drop-down list. Select the **Application Lifetime Events** performance counter, and click the **Add** button.
