Data binding enables you to synchronize the values of the properties of two different objects.       To establish a binding, use the Binding class or one of the other classes that inherit <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingBase>. Regardless of what object you are binding and the nature of your data source, each binding follows the model illustrated by the following figure.       ![Basic data binding diagram](~/add/media/databindingmostbasic.png \"Basic data binding diagram\")       The figure demonstrates the following fundamental [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] data binding concepts.      -   Each binding typically has these four components: a binding target object, a target property, a binding source, and a <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.Path%2A> to the value in the binding source to use. For example, if you want to bind the content of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> to the Name property of an Employee object, your target object is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox>, the target property is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.Text%2A> property, the value to use is Name, and the source object is the Employee object.      -   The target property must be a dependency property. This also means that you cannot bind a field. Most properties of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> objects are dependency properties and most dependency properties, except read-only ones, support data binding by default. (Only <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> types can define dependency properties and all <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> objects derive from <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject>.)      -   Although not specified in the figure, it should be noted that the binding source object is not restricted to being a custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] object.

For more information about these data binding concepts, see [Data Binding Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Use the Path property to specify the source value you want to bind to:      -   In the simplest case, the Path property value is the name of the property of the source object to use for the binding, such as `Path=PropertyName`.      -   Subproperties of a property can be specified by a syntax similar to that used in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_cshrp](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-cshrp-md.md)]. For instance, the clause `Path=ShoppingCart.Order` sets the binding to the subproperty `Order` of the object or property `ShoppingCart`.      -   To bind to an attached property, place parentheses around the attached property. For example, to bind to the attached property <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, the syntax is `Path=(DockPanel.Dock)`.      -   Indexers of a property can be specified within square brackets following the property name where the indexer is applied. For instance, the clause `Path=ShoppingCart[0]` sets the binding to the index that corresponds to how your property's internal indexing handles the literal string \"0\". Multiple indexers are also supported.      -   Indexers and subproperties can be mixed in a `Path` clause; for example, `Path=ShoppingCart.ShippingInfo[MailingAddress,Street].`      -   Inside indexers you can have multiple indexer parameters separated by commas (,). The type of each parameter can be specified with parentheses. For example, you can have `Path=\"[(sys:Int32)42,(sys:Int32)24]\"`, where `sys` is mapped to the `System` namespace.      -   When the source is a collection view, the current item can be specified with a slash (/). For example, the clause `Path=/` sets the binding to the current item in the view. When the source is a collection, this syntax specifies the current item of the default collection view.      -   Property names and slashes can be combined to traverse properties that are collections. For example, `Path=/Offices/ManagerName` specifies the current item of the source collection, which contains an `Offices` property that is also a collection. Its current item is an object that contains a `ManagerName` property.      -   Optionally, a period (.) path can be used to bind to the current source. For example, `Text=\"{Binding}\"` is equivalent to `Text=\"{Binding Path=.}\"`.       For information about path syntax, see [Binding Declarations Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) or [PropertyPath XAML Syntax](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).

Data binding enables you to synchronize the values of the properties of two different objects.  \\n  \\n To establish a binding, use the Binding class or one of the other classes that inherit <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingBase>. Regardless of what object you are binding and the nature of your data source, each binding follows the model illustrated by the following figure.  \\n  \\n ![Basic data binding diagram](~/add/media/databindingmostbasic.png \\\"Basic data binding diagram\\\")  \\n  \\n The figure demonstrates the following fundamental [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] data binding concepts.  \\n  \\n-   Each binding typically has these four components: a binding target object, a target property, a binding source, and a <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.Path%2A> to the value in the binding source to use. For example, if you want to bind the content of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> to the Name property of an Employee object, your target object is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox>, the target property is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.Text%2A> property, the value to use is Name, and the source object is the Employee object.  \\n  \\n-   The target property must be a dependency property. This also means that you cannot bind a field. Most properties of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> objects are dependency properties and most dependency properties, except read-only ones, support data binding by default. (Only <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> types can define dependency properties and all <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> objects derive from <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject>.)  \\n  \\n-   Although not specified in the figure, it should be noted that the binding source object is not restricted to being a custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] object. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] data binding supports data in the form of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] objects and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)]. To provide some examples, your binding source may be a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, any list object, a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] object that is associated with [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_adonet](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-adonet-md.md)] data or Web Services, or an XmlNode that contains your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] data.  \\n  \\n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.Mode%2A> property to specify the direction of the data flow. To detect source changes in one-way or two-way bindings, the source must implement a suitable property change notification mechanism such as <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged>. For an example, see [How to: Implement Property Change Notification](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md). The <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.UpdateSourceTrigger%2A> property specifies the timing of source updates.

For more information about these data binding concepts, see [Data Binding Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Use the Path property to specify the source value you want to bind to:  \\n  \\n-   In the simplest case, the Path property value is the name of the property of the source object to use for the binding, such as `Path=PropertyName`.  \\n  \\n-   Subproperties of a property can be specified by a syntax similar to that used in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_cshrp](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-cshrp-md.md)]. For instance, the clause `Path=ShoppingCart.Order` sets the binding to the subproperty `Order` of the object or property `ShoppingCart`.  \\n  \\n-   To bind to an attached property, place parentheses around the attached property. For example, to bind to the attached property <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, the syntax is `Path=(DockPanel.Dock)`.  \\n  \\n-   Indexers of a property can be specified within square brackets following the property name where the indexer is applied. For instance, the clause `Path=ShoppingCart[0]` sets the binding to the index that corresponds to how your property's internal indexing handles the literal string \\\"0\\\". Multiple indexers are also supported.  \\n  \\n-   Indexers and subproperties can be mixed in a `Path` clause; for example, `Path=ShoppingCart.ShippingInfo[MailingAddress,Street].`  \\n  \\n-   Inside indexers you can have multiple indexer parameters separated by commas (,). The type of each parameter can be specified with parentheses. For example, you can have `Path=\\\"[(sys:Int32)42,(sys:Int32)24]\\\"`, where `sys` is mapped to the `System` namespace.  \\n  \\n-   When the source is a collection view, the current item can be specified with a slash (/). For example, the clause `Path=/` sets the binding to the current item in the view. When the source is a collection, this syntax specifies the current item of the default collection view.  \\n  \\n-   Property names and slashes can be combined to traverse properties that are collections. For example, `Path=/Offices/ManagerName` specifies the current item of the source collection, which contains an `Offices` property that is also a collection. Its current item is an object that contains a `ManagerName` property.  \\n  \\n-   Optionally, a period (.) path can be used to bind to the current source. For example, `Text=\\\"{Binding}\\\"` is equivalent to `Text=\\\"{Binding Path=.}\\\"`.  \\n  \\n For information about path syntax, see [Binding Declarations Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) or [PropertyPath XAML Syntax](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n For [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xml](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-xml-md.md)] bindings, see the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.XPath%2A> property.  \\n  \\n To bind to an entire object, you do not need to specify the Path property.
