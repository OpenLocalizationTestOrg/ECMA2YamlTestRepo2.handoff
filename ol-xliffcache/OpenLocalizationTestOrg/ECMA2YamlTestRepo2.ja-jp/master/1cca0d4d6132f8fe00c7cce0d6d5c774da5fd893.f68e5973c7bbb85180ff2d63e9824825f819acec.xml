ApplicationSettingsBase supports the declarative model used for wrapper class properties, as described later.      -   Higher-level <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.Save%2A> and <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.Reload%2A> methods.      -   Additional validation events that you can handle to ensure the correctness of individual settings.       In the application settings architecture, to access a group of settings properties you need to derive a concrete wrapper class from ApplicationSettingsBase. The wrapper class customizes ApplicationSettingsBase in the following ways:      -   For every settings property to be accessed, a corresponding strongly typed public property is added to the wrapper class. This property has `get` and `set` accessors for read/write application settings, but only a `get` accessor for read-only settings.      -   Appropriated attributes must be applied to the wrapper class's public properties to indicate characteristics of the settings property, such as the setting's scope (application or user), whether the setting should support roaming, the default value for the setting, the settings provider to be used, and so on. Each property is required to specify its scope, using either <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationScopedSettingAttribute> or <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute>. Application-scoped settings are read-only if the default <xref:System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider> is used.       The ApplicationSettingsBase class uses reflection to detect these attributes at run time. Most of this information gets passed to the settings provider layer, which is responsible for storage, persistence format, and so on.       When an application has multiple settings wrapper classes, each class defines a *settings group*. Each group has the following characteristics:      -   A group can contain any number or type of property settings.      -   If the group name is not explicitly set by the decorating the wrapper class with a <xref:System.Configuration.SettingsGroupNameAttribute>, then a name is automatically generated.       By default, all client-based applications use the <xref:System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider> to provide storage. If an alternate settings provider is desired, then the wrapper class or property must be decorated with a corresponding <xref:System.Configuration.SettingsProviderAttribute>.

ApplicationSettingsBase supports the declarative model used for wrapper class properties, as described later.  \\n  \\n-   Higher-level <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.Save%2A> and <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.Reload%2A> methods.  \\n  \\n-   Additional validation events that you can handle to ensure the correctness of individual settings.  \\n  \\n In the application settings architecture, to access a group of settings properties you need to derive a concrete wrapper class from ApplicationSettingsBase. The wrapper class customizes ApplicationSettingsBase in the following ways:  \\n  \\n-   For every settings property to be accessed, a corresponding strongly typed public property is added to the wrapper class. This property has `get` and `set` accessors for read/write application settings, but only a `get` accessor for read-only settings.  \\n  \\n-   Appropriated attributes must be applied to the wrapper class's public properties to indicate characteristics of the settings property, such as the setting's scope (application or user), whether the setting should support roaming, the default value for the setting, the settings provider to be used, and so on. Each property is required to specify its scope, using either <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationScopedSettingAttribute> or <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute>. Application-scoped settings are read-only if the default <xref:System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider> is used.  \\n  \\n The ApplicationSettingsBase class uses reflection to detect these attributes at run time. Most of this information gets passed to the settings provider layer, which is responsible for storage, persistence format, and so on.  \\n  \\n When an application has multiple settings wrapper classes, each class defines a *settings group*. Each group has the following characteristics:  \\n  \\n-   A group can contain any number or type of property settings.  \\n  \\n-   If the group name is not explicitly set by the decorating the wrapper class with a <xref:System.Configuration.SettingsGroupNameAttribute>, then a name is automatically generated.  \\n  \\n By default, all client-based applications use the <xref:System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider> to provide storage. If an alternate settings provider is desired, then the wrapper class or property must be decorated with a corresponding <xref:System.Configuration.SettingsProviderAttribute>.  \\n  \\n For more information about using application settings, see [Application Settings for Windows Forms](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the use of application settings to persist the following attributes of the main form: location, size, background color, and title bar text. All of these attributes are persisted as single application settings properties in the `FormSettings` class, named `FormLocation`, `FormSize`, `FormBackColor` and `FormText`, respectively. All except for `FormText` and `Size` are data bound to their associated form properties and have a default setting value applied using <xref:System.Configuration.DefaultSettingValueAttribute>.  \\n  \\n The form contains four child controls that have the following names and functions:  \\n  \\n-   A button named `btnBackColor` used to display the **Color** common dialog box.  \\n  \\n-   A button named `btnReload` used to <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.Reload%2A> the application settings.  \\n  \\n-   A button named `btnReset` used to <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.Reset%2A> the application settings.  \\n  \\n-   A textbox named `tbStatus` used to display status information about the program.  \\n  \\n Notice that after every execution of the application, an additional period character is appended to the title text of the form.  \\n  \\n This code example requires a Form with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> class named `colorDialog1`, and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip> control with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripStatusLabel> named `tbStatus`.
