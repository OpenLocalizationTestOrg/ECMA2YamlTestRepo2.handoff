Otherwise, reading from the StandardError stream throws an exception.       The redirected StandardError stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the error output stream of the process.

This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.       Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the StandardError stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.       The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.      ```   // Start the child process.    Process p = new Process();    // Redirect the error stream of the child process.    p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;    p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;    p.StartInfo.FileName = \"Write500Lines.exe\";    p.Start();    // Do not wait for the child process to exit before    // reading to the end of its redirected error stream.    // p.WaitForExit();    // Read the error stream first and then wait.    string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();    p.WaitForExit();   ```       The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardError stream.       There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.      ```   // Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both    // redirected streams.   // string output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();   // string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();   // p.WaitForExit();   // Use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.   p.BeginOutputReadLine();   string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();   p.WaitForExit();   ```       The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardError stream.       You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.      > [!NOTE] >  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream.

The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its StandardOutput stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.       You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.      > [!NOTE] >  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode. For example, do not follow <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> with a call to <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> on the StandardOutput stream, or vice versa. However, you can read two different streams in different modes. For example, you can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> and then call <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"When a &lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.Process&gt;

When <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> is called, the StartInfo is used to specify the process to start. The only necessary StartInfo member to set is the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property. Starting a process by specifying the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property is similar to typing the information in the **Run** dialog box of the Windows **Start** menu. Therefore, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not need to represent an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application installed on the system. For example the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word. Similarly, in the same way that the **Run** dialog box can accept an executable file name with or without the .exe extension, the .exe extension is optional in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member. For example, you can set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property to either \"Notepad.exe\" or \"Notepad\".       You can start a ClickOnce application by setting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property to the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.       If the file name involves a nonexecutable file, such as a .doc file, you can include a verb specifying what action to take on the file. For example, you could set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> to \"Print\" for a file ending in the .doc extension. The file name specified in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not need to have an extension if you manually enter a value for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> property. However, if you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verbs%2A> property to determine what verbs are available, you must include the extension.       You can change the parameters specified in the StartInfo property up to the time that you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method on the process. After you start the process, changing the StartInfo values does not affect or restart the associated process. If you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo%29> method with the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UserName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Password%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties set, the unmanaged `CreateProcessWithLogonW` function is called, which starts the process in a new window even if the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.CreateNoWindow%2A> property value is `true` or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.WindowStyle%2A> property value is <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle>.       If you did not use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method to start a process, the StartInfo property does not reflect the parameters used to start the process. For example, if you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses%2A> to get an array of processes running on the computer, the StartInfo property of each <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> does not contain the original file name or arguments used to start the process.

If you want to set the executable file of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance for which an associated process has not been started, use the StartInfo property's <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member. Because the members of the StartInfo property are arguments that are passed to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method of a process, changing the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property after the associated process has started will not reset the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property.

You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \\n  \\n A Process component provides access to a process that is running on a computer. A process, in the simplest terms, is a running app. A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the code of the process, including parts currently being executed by another thread.  \\n  \\n The Process component is a useful tool for starting, stopping, controlling, and monitoring apps. You can use the Process component, to obtain a list of the processes that are running, or you can start a new process. A Process component is used to access system processes. After a Process component has been initialized, it can be used to obtain information about the running process. Such information includes the set of threads, the loaded modules (.dll and .exe files), and performance information such as the amount of memory the process is using.  \\n  \\n This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  32-bit processes cannot access the modules of a 64-bit process. If you try to get information about a 64-bit process from a 32-bit process, you will get a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception> exception. A 64-bit process, on the other hand, can access the modules of a 32-bit process.  \\n  \\n The process component obtains information about a group of properties all at once. After the Process component has obtained information about one member of any group, it will cache the values for the other properties in that group and not obtain new information about the other members of the group until you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. Therefore, a property value is not guaranteed to be any newer than the last call to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. The group breakdowns are operating-system dependent.  \\n  \\n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\\\"c:\\\\mypath\\\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\\\mypath` when starting it.  \\n  \\n A system process is uniquely identified on the system by its process identifier. Like many Windows resources, a process is also identified by its handle, which might not be unique on the computer. A handle is the generic term for an identifier of a resource. The operating system persists the process handle, which is accessed through the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> property of the Process component, even when the process has exited. Thus, you can get the process's administrative information, such as the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode%2A> (usually either zero for success or a nonzero error code) and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A>. Handles are an extremely valuable resource, so leaking handles is more virulent than leaking memory.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  This class contains a link demand and an inheritance demand at the class level that applies to all members. A <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when either the immediate caller or the derived class does not have full-trust permission.

For example code, on systems whose culture is English (United States), code page 437 is the default encoding for the <xref:System.Console> class. However, [!INCLUDE[net_core](~/add/includes/net-core-md.md)] may make only a limited subset of these encodings available. If this is the case, it uses <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF8%2A?displayProperty=fullName> as the default encoding.  \\n  \\n If a Process object depends on specific code page encodings, you can still make them available by doing the following *before* you call any Process methods:  \\n  \\n1.  Add a reference to the System.Text.Encoding.CodePages.dll assembly to your project.  \\n  \\n2.  Retrieve the <xref:System.Text.EncodingProvider> object from the <xref:System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \\n  \\n3.  Pass the <xref:System.Text.EncodingProvider> object to the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.RegisterProvider%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to make the additional encodings supported by the encoding provider available.  \\n  \\n The Process class will then automatically use the default system encoding rather than UTF8, provided that you have registered the encoding provider before calling any Process methods.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example uses an instance of the Process class to start a process.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Process.Start_instance#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.diagnostics.pro_1_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-vb[Process.Start_instance#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.diagnostics.pro_1_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[Process.Start_instance#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.diagnostics.pro_1_1.cs)]  \\n  \\n The following example uses the Process class itself and a static <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method to start a process.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[Process.Start_static#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.diagnostics.pro_1_2.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[Process.Start_static#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.diagnostics.pro_1_2.cs)]\\n [!code-cpp[Process.Start_static#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.diagnostics.pro_1_2.cpp)]  \\n  \\n The following F# example defines a `runProc` function that starts a process, captures all output and error information, and records the number of milliseconds that the process has run.

The EnableRaisingEvents property is used in asynchronous processing to notify your application that a process has exited.

By redirecting the StandardError stream, you can manipulate or suppress the error output of a process. For example, you can filter the text, format it differently, or write the output to both the console and a designated log file.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To use StandardError, you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `false`, and you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardError%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `true`. Otherwise, reading from the StandardError stream throws an exception.  \\n  \\n The redirected StandardError stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the error output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes to its StandardError stream, or closes the stream.  \\n  \\n In contrast, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginErrorReadLine%2A> starts asynchronous read operations on the StandardError stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.  \\n  \\n Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the StandardError stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.  \\n  \\n The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.  \\n  \\n```  \\n// Start the child process.  \\n Process p = new Process();  \\n // Redirect the error stream of the child process.  \\n p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;  \\n p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;  \\n p.StartInfo.FileName = \\\"Write500Lines.exe\\\";  \\n p.Start();  \\n // Do not wait for the child process to exit before  \\n // reading to the end of its redirected error stream.  \\n // p.WaitForExit();  \\n // Read the error stream first and then wait.  \\n string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \\n p.WaitForExit();  \\n```  \\n  \\n The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardError stream.  \\n  \\n There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.  \\n  \\n```  \\n// Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both   \\n// redirected streams.  \\n// string output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();  \\n// string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \\n// p.WaitForExit();  \\n// Use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.  \\np.BeginOutputReadLine();  \\nstring error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \\np.WaitForExit();  \\n```  \\n  \\n The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardError stream.  \\n  \\n You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode. For example, do not follow <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginErrorReadLine%2A> with a call to <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> on the StandardError stream, or vice versa.

By redirecting the StandardOutput stream, you can manipulate or suppress the output of a process. For example, you can filter the text, format it differently, or write the output to both the console and a designated log file.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To use StandardOutput, you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `false`, and you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `true`. Otherwise, reading from the StandardOutput stream throws an exception.  \\n  \\n The redirected StandardOutput stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes to its StandardOutput stream, or closes the stream.  \\n  \\n In contrast, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> starts asynchronous read operations on the StandardOutput stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.  \\n  \\n Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the StandardOutput stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.  \\n  \\n The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.  \\n  \\n```  \\nProcess p = new Process();  \\np.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;  \\np.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;  \\np.StartInfo.FileName = \\\"Write500Lines.exe\\\";  \\np.Start();  \\n  \\n// To avoid deadlocks, always read the output stream first and then wait.  \\nstring output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();  \\np.WaitForExit();  \\n```  \\n  \\n The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardOutput stream.  \\n  \\n There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.  \\n  \\n```  \\n// To avoid deadlocks, use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.  \\n// Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both redirected streams.  \\np.BeginOutputReadLine();  \\nstring error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \\np.WaitForExit();  \\n```  \\n  \\n The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the StandardOutput stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its StandardOutput stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.  \\n  \\n You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode. For example, do not follow <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> with a call to <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> on the StandardOutput stream, or vice versa. However, you can read two different streams in different modes. For example, you can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> and then call <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example runs the ipconfig.exe command and redirects its standard output to the example’s console window.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[Process_StandardOutput#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.diagnostics.pro_11_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[Process_StandardOutput#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.diagnostics.pro_11_1.cs)]\\n [!code-cpp[Process_StandardOutput#2](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/p-system.diagnostics.pro_11_1.cpp)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.IO.StreamReader StandardOutput { get; }\n    return:\n      type: System.IO.StreamReader\n      description: A <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> that can be used to read the standard output stream of the application.\n  overload: System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.InvalidOperationException\n    commentId: T:System.InvalidOperationException\n    description: \"The StandardOutput stream has not been defined for redirection; ensure &lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt; is set to <xref uid=\\\"langword_csharp_true\\\" name=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"\\\"></xref> and &lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt; is set to <xref uid=\\\"langword_csharp_false\\\" name=\\\"false\\\" href=\\\"\\\"></xref>.  \\n  \\n \\\\- or -  \\n  \\n The StandardOutput stream has been opened for asynchronous read operations with <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine*>.\"\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Diagnostics.Process.Start\n  id: Start\n  parent: System.Diagnostics.Process\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Start()\n  nameWithType: Process.Start()\n  fullName: System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  namespace: System.Diagnostics\n  summary: Starts (or reuses) the process resource that is specified by the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo*> property of this <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process\"></xref> component and associates it with the component.\n  remarks: \"Use this overload to start a process resource and associate it with the current <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component.

The process resource is automatically associated with the new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component that is returned by the Start method.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> members can be used to duplicate the functionality of the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu.

The <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not have to be an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application that is installed on the system. For example, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc extension if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word.  \\n  \\n In the command line, you can specify actions to take for certain types of files. For example, you can print documents or edit text files. Specify these actions using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> member of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property. For other types of files, you can specify command-line arguments when you start the file from the `Run` dialog box.

The only necessary StartInfo member to set is the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property. Starting a process by specifying the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property is similar to typing the information in the **Run** dialog box of the Windows **Start** menu. Therefore, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not need to represent an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application installed on the system. For example the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word. Similarly, in the same way that the **Run** dialog box can accept an executable file name with or without the .exe extension, the .exe extension is optional in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member. For example, you can set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property to either \\\"Notepad.exe\\\" or \\\"Notepad\\\".  \\n  \\n You can start a ClickOnce application by setting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property to the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.  \\n  \\n If the file name involves a nonexecutable file, such as a .doc file, you can include a verb specifying what action to take on the file. For example, you could set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> to \\\"Print\\\" for a file ending in the .doc extension. The file name specified in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not need to have an extension if you manually enter a value for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> property. However, if you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verbs%2A> property to determine what verbs are available, you must include the extension.  \\n  \\n You can change the parameters specified in the StartInfo property up to the time that you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method on the process. After you start the process, changing the StartInfo values does not affect or restart the associated process. If you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo%29> method with the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UserName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Password%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties set, the unmanaged `CreateProcessWithLogonW` function is called, which starts the process in a new window even if the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.CreateNoWindow%2A> property value is `true` or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.WindowStyle%2A> property value is <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle>.  \\n  \\n If you did not use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method to start a process, the StartInfo property does not reflect the parameters used to start the process. For example, if you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses%2A> to get an array of processes running on the computer, the StartInfo property of each <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> does not contain the original file name or arguments used to start the process.  \\n  \\n When the process is started, the file name is the file that populates the (read-only) <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. If you want to retrieve the executable file that is associated with the process after the process has started, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. If you want to set the executable file of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance for which an associated process has not been started, use the StartInfo property's <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member. Because the members of the StartInfo property are arguments that are passed to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method of a process, changing the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property after the associated process has started will not reset the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. These properties are used only to initialize the associated process.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example populates a StartInfo with the file to execute, the action performed on it and whether it should displays a user interface.
