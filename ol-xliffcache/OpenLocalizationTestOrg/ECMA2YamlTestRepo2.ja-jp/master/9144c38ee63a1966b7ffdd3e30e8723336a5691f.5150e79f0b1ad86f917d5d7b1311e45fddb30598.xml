A build provider can use this property to make sure that the provider generates code that is appropriate for the targeted version of the .NET Framework. For example, you might want to generate different code depending on whether a Web site targets the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](~/add/includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](~/add/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)]. For more information about multi-targeting, see [.NET Framework Multi-Targeting for ASP.NET Web Projects](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       If the Web site does not have a Web.config file, ASP.NET assumes that the target framework version is the version that is associated with the IIS application pool that the site is running under. For a file-system Web site that is running in Visual Studio, the default framework version is the current version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].       If the Web site does have a Web.config file, ASP.NET determines the target framework by examining the Web.config file.      ## Web Sites that Target the .NET Framework 2.0    Web applications that target the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] are compiled as if the target were the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)]. The build process does not differentiate between the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)] because the Web.config file does not indicate compiler version or target framework when one of those versions is targeted. (For the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](~/add/includes/net-v35-short-md.md)], the Web.config file specifies the compiler version, and for the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](~/add/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)], the Web.config file specifies the target framework.) Therefore, for Web applications that target the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)], this property returns a target framework moniker that indicates the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)].       This normally will not cause any problems. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/add/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] prevents you from creating references to [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)] features in a project that is targeted for the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)]. For example, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/add/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] does not provide item templates for WCF services in a project that is targeted for [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)], because WCF was introduced with the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)] and is not compatible with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].

A build provider can use this property to make sure that the provider generates code that is appropriate for the targeted version of the .NET Framework. For example, you might want to generate different code depending on whether a Web site targets the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](~/add/includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](~/add/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)]. For more information about multi-targeting, see [.NET Framework Multi-Targeting for ASP.NET Web Projects](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n If the Web site does not have a Web.config file, ASP.NET assumes that the target framework version is the version that is associated with the IIS application pool that the site is running under. For a file-system Web site that is running in Visual Studio, the default framework version is the current version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].  \\n  \\n If the Web site does have a Web.config file, ASP.NET determines the target framework by examining the Web.config file.  \\n  \\n## Web Sites that Target the .NET Framework 2.0  \\n Web applications that target the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] are compiled as if the target were the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)]. The build process does not differentiate between the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)] because the Web.config file does not indicate compiler version or target framework when one of those versions is targeted. (For the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](~/add/includes/net-v35-short-md.md)], the Web.config file specifies the compiler version, and for the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](~/add/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)], the Web.config file specifies the target framework.) Therefore, for Web applications that target the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)], this property returns a target framework moniker that indicates the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)].  \\n  \\n This normally will not cause any problems. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/add/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] prevents you from creating references to [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)] features in a project that is targeted for the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)]. For example, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/add/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] does not provide item templates for WCF services in a project that is targeted for [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)], because WCF was introduced with the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)] and is not compatible with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].  \\n  \\n If you plan to deploy a Web site in a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] run-time environment and you use a tool other than [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/add/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] to reference features that are compatible only with [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](~/add/includes/net-v30-short-md.md)], the project might build without generating errors or warnings. However, the application might generate errors when the Web site runs on the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/add/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public static
