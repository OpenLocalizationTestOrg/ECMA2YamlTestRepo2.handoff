The .NET Framework maps a single derived control adapter to a <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> object for each client request.       An adapter modifies a control for a specific browser or class of browsers or acts as an arbitrary filter on some capability. Typically the adapter is defined by the markup language that the browser uses (for example, XHTML or HTML 3.2). Much of the adaptability in rendering behavior can be encapsulated in the specialized classes that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter> class. Therefore, it is likely that a single adapter can be used for a number of browser class behaviors or that inclusion of the adaptability in the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter> classes could make the use of a control adapter unnecessary.       An adapter for a control class applies to all controls that inherit from that class, unless more specialized adapters are present. For example, an adapter for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseValidator> class can be used for all `Validator` objects.       Adapters typically do not inherit directly from the ControlAdapter class, but from one of the target-specific adapter base classes that provide additional functionality specific to the control type and target browser or the particular rendering required.       Controls themselves do not necessarily require an adapter. If controls are extended through composition, generally the child control adapters are sufficient.       Each control has explicit mappings to adapters through the .browser definition files. Thus, any access to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Adapter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property uses the <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilities> object extracted from the browser definition files to perform the lookup for the mapping of the adapter to control.       During processing, the .NET Framework intercepts calls to the overridable methods of a control that could be target-specific. If a control adapter is attached, the .NET Framework calls the associated adapter methods.       The adapter performs rendering for the control through the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> method. If overridden, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> potentially should not call the base class implementation because that performs a call back on the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Render%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. This might cause the rendering to occur twice, once by the adapter and once by the control.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> base method calls back on the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Render%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method of the control. Thus, if you override <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A>, you should not call the base class implementation unless the rendering you implement is in addition to that provided by <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Render%2A?displayProperty=fullName> of the control.       You must ensure that the .NET Framework performs interception for adapters of the child controls. You can do this by calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.RenderChildren%2A> base method, which calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.RenderChildren%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method of the control, from your <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> override.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.EndRender%2A> methods are called by the control immediately before and after (respectively) the control calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> method. If pre- and post-rendering are the only browser-specific processing tasks required, using <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.EndRender%2A> might make it unnecessary to override <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A>. The default behavior of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.EndRender%2A> methods is to call the corresponding methods of the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter>.       To maintain its own state information, a control adapter can override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterViewState%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterViewState%2A> methods. <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterViewState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterControlState%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterViewState%2A> are called when the private control and view states are saved and loaded, respectively.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnInit%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnLoad%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnPreRender%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnUnload%2A> base methods call back on the corresponding <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class methods. Thus, any of these ControlAdapter methods that are overridden must call their base methods; otherwise, the event associated with the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class method will not be raised.       Controls and adapters optionally implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackDataHandler> and <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackEventHandler> interfaces. The .NET Framework determines whether an adapter exists and whether the adapter implements these interfaces. If it does, the adapter should override the <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackDataHandler.LoadPostData%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackDataHandler.RaisePostDataChangedEvent%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackEventHandler.RaisePostBackEvent%2A> methods, as necessary.

The .NET Framework maps a single derived control adapter to a <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> object for each client request.  \\n  \\n An adapter modifies a control for a specific browser or class of browsers or acts as an arbitrary filter on some capability. Typically the adapter is defined by the markup language that the browser uses (for example, XHTML or HTML 3.2). Much of the adaptability in rendering behavior can be encapsulated in the specialized classes that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter> class. Therefore, it is likely that a single adapter can be used for a number of browser class behaviors or that inclusion of the adaptability in the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter> classes could make the use of a control adapter unnecessary.  \\n  \\n An adapter for a control class applies to all controls that inherit from that class, unless more specialized adapters are present. For example, an adapter for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseValidator> class can be used for all `Validator` objects.  \\n  \\n Adapters typically do not inherit directly from the ControlAdapter class, but from one of the target-specific adapter base classes that provide additional functionality specific to the control type and target browser or the particular rendering required.  \\n  \\n Controls themselves do not necessarily require an adapter. If controls are extended through composition, generally the child control adapters are sufficient.  \\n  \\n Each control has explicit mappings to adapters through the .browser definition files. Thus, any access to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Adapter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property uses the <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilities> object extracted from the browser definition files to perform the lookup for the mapping of the adapter to control.  \\n  \\n During processing, the .NET Framework intercepts calls to the overridable methods of a control that could be target-specific. If a control adapter is attached, the .NET Framework calls the associated adapter methods.  \\n  \\n The adapter performs rendering for the control through the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> method. If overridden, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> potentially should not call the base class implementation because that performs a call back on the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Render%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. This might cause the rendering to occur twice, once by the adapter and once by the control.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> base method calls back on the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Render%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method of the control. Thus, if you override <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A>, you should not call the base class implementation unless the rendering you implement is in addition to that provided by <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Render%2A?displayProperty=fullName> of the control.  \\n  \\n You must ensure that the .NET Framework performs interception for adapters of the child controls. You can do this by calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.RenderChildren%2A> base method, which calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.RenderChildren%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method of the control, from your <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> override.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.EndRender%2A> methods are called by the control immediately before and after (respectively) the control calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A> method. If pre- and post-rendering are the only browser-specific processing tasks required, using <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.EndRender%2A> might make it unnecessary to override <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.Render%2A>. The default behavior of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.EndRender%2A> methods is to call the corresponding methods of the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter>.  \\n  \\n To maintain its own state information, a control adapter can override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterViewState%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterViewState%2A> methods. <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.SaveAdapterViewState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterControlState%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.LoadAdapterViewState%2A> are called when the private control and view states are saved and loaded, respectively.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnInit%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnLoad%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnPreRender%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.OnUnload%2A> base methods call back on the corresponding <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class methods. Thus, any of these ControlAdapter methods that are overridden must call their base methods; otherwise, the event associated with the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class method will not be raised.  \\n  \\n Controls and adapters optionally implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackDataHandler> and <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackEventHandler> interfaces. The .NET Framework determines whether an adapter exists and whether the adapter implements these interfaces. If it does, the adapter should override the <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackDataHandler.LoadPostData%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackDataHandler.RaisePostDataChangedEvent%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.IPostBackEventHandler.RaisePostBackEvent%2A> methods, as necessary. If the postback data is not recognized in the adapter, it must call back on the control to process it. Subsequent event handlers also must call back on the control.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public abstract class ControlAdapter\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: ControlAdapter()\n  nameWithType: ControlAdapter.ControlAdapter()\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.ControlAdapter()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.Adapters\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: The .NET Framework internally constructs this adapter when it creates the corresponding <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> object.\n  syntax:\n    content: protected ControlAdapter ();\n    parameters: []\n  overload: System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.#ctor*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender(System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter)\n  id: BeginRender(System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter)\n  parent: System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: BeginRender(HtmlTextWriter)\n  nameWithType: ControlAdapter.BeginRender(HtmlTextWriter)\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter.BeginRender(HtmlTextWriter)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.Adapters\n  summary: Called prior to the rendering of a control.
