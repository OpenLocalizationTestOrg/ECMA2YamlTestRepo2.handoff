The following graphic shows an example of a TextBox.       ![TextBox screen shot](~/add/media/ss-ctl-textbox.gif \"TextBox screen shot\")   Example of a TextBox       TextBox is a composite control that is composed of several encapsulated components. Consequently, some events do not bubble up to the containing control because they are handled by encapsulated child elements. Because of this, application developers should listen for the tunneling version of an event (denoted by the prefix \"Preview\").       TextBox supports unformatted text only. For applications that require support for richer content, see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox>. For applications that need to accept passwords or other sensitive input, see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox>.       Horizontally and vertically aligning text within a TextBox is done with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.HorizontalContentAlignment%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.VerticalContentAlignment%2A> properties. Aligning the TextBox within the layout of the page is done with the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> properties.       The best way to hide the border around a TextBox is to set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderThickness%2A> property of the TextBox to `0`.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  TextBox has built-in handling for the bubbling  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseUp> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> events. Consequently, custom event handlers that listen for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseUp> or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> events from a TextBox will not be called. If you need to respond to these events, listen for the tunneling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseUp> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseDown> events instead, or register the handlers with the <xref:System.Windows.EventSetter.HandledEventsToo%2A> argument (this latter option is only available through code). Do not mark the event handled unless you deliberately want to disable TextBox native handling of these events, and be aware that this has notable effects on the control's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)].       Scrollbars are not visible on a TextBox by default. To make scrollbars visible, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.VerticalScrollBarVisibility%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility%2A> properties to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility>.       Usually the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.TextChanged> event should be used to detect whenever the text in a TextBox or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox> changes rather then <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown> as you might expect. See [How to: Detect When Text in a TextBox Has Changed](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) for an example.      ## Customizing the TextBox Control    To apply the same property settings to multiple TextBox controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the TextBox, see [TextBox Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.

The following graphic shows an example of a TextBox.  \\n  \\n ![TextBox screen shot](~/add/media/ss-ctl-textbox.gif \\\"TextBox screen shot\\\")  \\nExample of a TextBox  \\n  \\n TextBox is a composite control that is composed of several encapsulated components. Consequently, some events do not bubble up to the containing control because they are handled by encapsulated child elements. Because of this, application developers should listen for the tunneling version of an event (denoted by the prefix \\\"Preview\\\").  \\n  \\n TextBox supports unformatted text only. For applications that require support for richer content, see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox>. For applications that need to accept passwords or other sensitive input, see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox>.  \\n  \\n Horizontally and vertically aligning text within a TextBox is done with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.HorizontalContentAlignment%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.VerticalContentAlignment%2A> properties. Aligning the TextBox within the layout of the page is done with the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n The best way to hide the border around a TextBox is to set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderThickness%2A> property of the TextBox to `0`.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  TextBox has built-in handling for the bubbling  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseUp> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> events. Consequently, custom event handlers that listen for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseUp> or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> events from a TextBox will not be called. If you need to respond to these events, listen for the tunneling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseUp> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseDown> events instead, or register the handlers with the <xref:System.Windows.EventSetter.HandledEventsToo%2A> argument (this latter option is only available through code). Do not mark the event handled unless you deliberately want to disable TextBox native handling of these events, and be aware that this has notable effects on the control's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)].  \\n  \\n Scrollbars are not visible on a TextBox by default. To make scrollbars visible, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.VerticalScrollBarVisibility%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility%2A> properties to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility>.  \\n  \\n Usually the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.TextChanged> event should be used to detect whenever the text in a TextBox or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox> changes rather then <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown> as you might expect. See [How to: Detect When Text in a TextBox Has Changed](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) for an example.  \\n  \\n## Customizing the TextBox Control  \\n To apply the same property settings to multiple TextBox controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the TextBox, see [TextBox Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in TextBox control's default template and is set by using a . You can find a list of visual properties in the \\\"Changing the Visual Structure of a Control\\\" section in [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](../Topic/Customizing%20the%20Appearance%20of%20an%20Existing%20Control%20by%20Creating%20a%20ControlTemplate.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"This example shows how to use the Text property to set the initial text contents of a TextBox control.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Although the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) version of the example could use the \\\\<TextBox.Text> tags around the text of each button's TextBox content, it is not necessary because the TextBox applies the ContentPropertyAttribute attribute to the Text property.  \\n  \\n```xaml  \\n<TextBox Name=\\\"tbSettingText\\\">  \\n  Initial text contents of the TextBox.  \\n</TextBox>  \\n```  \\n  \\n```c#  \\ntbSettingText.Text = \\\"Initial text contents of the TextBox.\\\";  \\n```  \\n  \\n```vb  \\ntbSettingText.Text = \\\"Initial text contents of the TextBox.\\\"  \\n```  \\n  \\n For additional examples, see the 4.0 version of this document: [TextBox Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms617604\\\\(v=vs.100\\\\).aspx).\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Windows.Localizability(System.Windows.LocalizationCategory.Text)]\n\n      [System.Windows.Markup.ContentProperty(\"Text\")]\n\n      public class TextBox : System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase, System.Windows.Markup.IAddChild\n  inheritance:\n  -
