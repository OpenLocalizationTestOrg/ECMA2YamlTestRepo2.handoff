The MessageQueueCriteria class, when used with the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.GetPublicQueues%2A> method, allows you to refine your filter.

Specific methods for filtering by queue label, category, or server location are the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.GetPublicQueuesByLabel%2A>, <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.GetPublicQueuesByCategory%2A>, and <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.GetPublicQueuesByMachine%2A>.  \\n  \\n The MessageQueueCriteria class, when used with the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.GetPublicQueues%2A> method, allows you to refine your filter. You can specify search criteria not specifically addressed through one of the `GetPublicQueuesBy`* methods, or by multiple criteria. You can pass a MessageQueueCriteria instance into the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.GetPublicQueues%2A> method in order to search, for example, by queue creation or modification times, the computer the queue resides on, the queue label or category, or any combination of these properties.  \\n  \\n When filtering by multiple properties, the criteria are composed by applying the `AND` operator to the set of properties. Thus, when you specify a value for the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.CreatedAfter%2A> property together with the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.MachineName%2A> property, you are asking for all queues that were created after a specified time and that reside on a specific computer.  \\n  \\n When you set any property, the method that sets the property also sets a flag to indicate that it should be included in the filter you are building. You cannot remove individual properties from the search filter. Instead, you remove all properties from the filter by calling <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.ClearAll%2A>, and then set the properties that you do want to build into the search filter. <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.ClearAll%2A> resets all properties into a \\\"not set\\\" default state.  \\n  \\n You must set a property before trying to read it; otherwise, an exception is thrown.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example iterates through message queues and displays the path of each queue that was created in the last day and that exists on the computer \\\"MyComputer\\\".  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[MessageQueue.GetMessageQueueEnumerator_criteria#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.messaging.messa_8_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cpp[MessageQueue.GetMessageQueueEnumerator_criteria#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.messaging.messa_8_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-cs[MessageQueue.GetMessageQueueEnumerator_criteria#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.messaging.messa_8_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public class MessageQueueCriteria\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: MessageQueueCriteria()\n  nameWithType: MessageQueueCriteria.MessageQueueCriteria()\n  fullName: System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.MessageQueueCriteria()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Messaging\n  namespace: System.Messaging\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria\"></xref> class.\n  syntax:\n    content: public MessageQueueCriteria ();\n    parameters: []\n  overload: System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.#ctor*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.Category\n  id: Category\n  parent: System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Category\n  nameWithType: MessageQueueCriteria.Category\n  fullName: System.Messaging.MessageQueueCriteria.Category\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Messaging\n  namespace: System.Messaging\n  summary: Gets or sets the category by which to filter queues in the network.\n  remarks: \"The queue category allows an application to categorize its queues.
