An EditorPart control allows a user to edit an associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control by modifying its layout, appearance, properties, behavior, or other characteristics.  \\n  \\n The editing user interface (UI), which consists of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zones that contain EditorPart controls, is displayed after a Web page enters edit mode.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  An EditorPart control can be used only within a zone that derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control.  \\n  \\n After a page has entered edit mode, a user can select a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control to edit by clicking an edit verb on the verbs menu of the selected control. Only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can be edited at a time.  \\n  \\n Several derived EditorPart controls are provided with the Web Parts control set, as listed in the following table. These controls provide all the editing capabilities that are necessary for most applications. The typical approach for using these controls in a Web Parts page is to declare them in page persistence format within a `<zonetemplate>` element, where `<zonetemplate>` is the child element of an `<asp:editorzone>` element. For a code example, see the Example section of this topic.  \\n  \\n|Type of control|Description|  \\n|---------------------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.AppearanceEditorPart>|Edits the appearance of the associated control, including properties such as its title text, height, width, and border attributes.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.BehaviorEditorPart>|Edits certain behaviors of the associated control, such as whether it can be edited, whether it can be closed, or whether it can be moved to another zone. This control is only visible on a page when a control is being edited in shared personalization scope.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.LayoutEditorPart>|Edits layout attributes for the associated control, such as whether it is in a normal or minimized (collapsed) state, and what zone it is placed in.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PropertyGridEditorPart>|Edits properties of the associated control, if those properties were declared in the source code with a `WebBrowsable` attribute.|  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To improve accessibility, all the EditorPart controls provided in the Web Parts control set are rendered within a `<fieldset>` element. The `<fieldset>` element groups the related set of controls used for editing in a given EditorPart control, and it facilitates tabbed navigation among those controls for both visual user agents (such as ordinary Web browsers) and speech-oriented user agents (such as screen-reading software).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates declarative and programmatic use of EditorPart controls. This code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that contains an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control, with several of the EditorPart controls from the Web Parts control set declared in the zone, and a reference to a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n-   A class that contains the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, and a custom EditorPart control for editing a property in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works when you load the page in a browser.  \\n  \\n The first part of this code example is the user control that enables users to change display modes on a Web page.

For every <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone that contains the control calls the SyncChanges method immediately after calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart.ApplyChanges%2A> method, so that the values in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control are always synchronized with the values in the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. Another case where the SyncChanges method is called is when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is entering edit mode.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The SyncChanges method is not called after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart.ApplyChanges%2A> method if that method returns `false`, because in that case, an error has occurred.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to implement the SyncChanges method in a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> class overview.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example demonstrates the implementation of the SyncChanges method in the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> class named `TextDisplayEditorPart`. This method gets a reference to the associated `TextDisplayWebPart` control using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart.WebPartToEdit%2A> property. It then gets the value of the `TextDisplayWebPart.FontStyle` property, and updates which item is selected in the drop-down list control (referenced by the `TextDisplayEditorPart.PartContentFontStyle` property) on the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorPart_Overview#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_198_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorPart_Overview#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_198_1.vb)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example shows how the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, `TextDisplayWebPart`, creates a collection of associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls (in this case, there is only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control named `TextDisplayEditorPart` in the collection) in its implementation of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts%2A> method. This method is executed when the `TextDisplayWebPart` control enters edit mode.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorPart_Overview#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_198_2.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorPart_Overview#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_198_2.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public abstract void SyncChanges ();\n    parameters: []\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart.SyncChanges*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart.WebPartManager\n  id: WebPartManager\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: WebPartManager\n  nameWithType: EditorPart.WebPartManager\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart.WebPartManager\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Gets a reference to the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\"></xref> control associated with the current Web page.\n  remarks: An <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control needs a reference to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> instance because it must check the current personalization scope of the page to determine the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart.Display%2A> property.
