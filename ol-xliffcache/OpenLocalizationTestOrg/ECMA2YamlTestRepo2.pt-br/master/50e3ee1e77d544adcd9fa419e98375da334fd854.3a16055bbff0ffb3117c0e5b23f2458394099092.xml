type: Class\n  summary: An abstract class that when implemented specifies security property requirements of the token being requested or authenticated that are specific to [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]. The security token manager constructs security token providers and security token authenticators that are used by the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] security processor based on the token requirement.\n  remarks: \"A security token is a cryptographically signed data unit that transfers authentication and authorization information, based on a credential. The derived class is used by a security token manager to specify what is required of a security token, such as the key size, key type, and how the key can be used. When a security token can be identified that matches the specified criteria, a <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.SecurityTokenProvider> and <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.SecurityTokenAuthenticator> can be created to provide security tokens for outgoing SOAP messages and to authenticate security tokens for incoming SOAP messages, respectively. For example, the default security token manager for outgoing SOAP messages has the `CreateSecurityTokenProvider` method that takes a <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.SecurityTokenRequirement> parameter that can be called to obtain a security token provider that matches the security token provider.  \\n  \\n This class's base class, <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.SecurityTokenRequirement>, contains a dictionary, <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.SecurityTokenRequirement.Properties%2A>, which maps property names to their values. This class has numerous properties whose name ends in the word \\\"Property\\\". These properties return a string, which is the key used to `get` or `set` the corresponding value from the dictionary.
