This mode is used by the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> class to support data binding.  \\n  \\n **Target mode** describes a path to a property that will be set as a target property. This mode is used by animation in support of storyboard and timeline setters.  \\n  \\n For instance, `Background.Opacity` is a two-step path. This path implies: first, find the `Background` property of an object, get the value object that the `Background` property is set to, and then get the value of the `Opacity` property on that object.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xamlAttributeUsage_PropertyPath\\\"></a>   \\n## XAML Attribute Usage  \\n  \\n```  \\n<object property=\\\"propertyPath\\\" .../>  \\n```  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xamlValues_PropertyPath\\\"></a>   \\n## XAML Values  \\n *propertyPath*  \\n A string that is evaluated to be either a simple or complex property path.

A provided <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> is converted to a string through <xref:System.Windows.Markup.DependencyPropertyConverter>. The <xref:System.Windows.Markup.DependencyPropertyConverter> supports a qualified naming format for dependency properties, so you can specify a *typeName*.*propertyName* qualified dependency property name string to the PropertyPath constructor in code. The qualified path to the dependency property identifier is a different concept than a complex path.

For example, to specify the first item in the array, the string token is `(0)`.  \\n  \\n-   Relationships between items (\\\"steps\\\" in the path) are specified by a dot (.). The property forward of the dot is the first step in the path, the property after is the second step, and so on (you can specify steps beyond two). The last step in the chain always represents the property being animated.  \\n  \\n-   Items within collection properties are accessed with an indexer syntax, with the index within square brackets ([ and ]). The indexer is additive to the token representing the property. For example, the following is a two-step path, with the token combination in the first step specifying the second item from within the collection of that property: `(0)[1].(1)` . You cannot use an indexer on the last property in the chain; you cannot animate the actual collection position, you must animate a property on that object.  \\n  \\n The path string for a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> is typically established through the constructors: the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.%23ctor%28System.Object%29> signature for bindings or single-step storyboard targets, the [PropertyPath(String, Object\\\\[\\\\])](assetId:///M:System.Windows.PropertyPath.#ctor(System.String,System.Object[])?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=False) signature for multi-step storyboard targets.  \\n  \\n **XAML:** When you use a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> to describe a property reference in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], as an attribute value, the string that you specify is first handled by a type converter (<xref:System.Windows.PropertyPathConverter>). This type converter then processes the string and based on its syntax will call one of the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> constructor signatures.

For setting PathParameters, the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.%23ctor%2A> constructor is particularly convenient because the `pathParameters` constructor argument is designated as `params`, meaning that you do not need to create or dimension an array for construction. You simply specify each member of the array as an additional parameter.  \\n  \\n If the final property that is the target is a <xref:System.Windows.Freezable> type, that value will be cloned. For details, see [Storyboards Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n The actual evaluation of the property chain is performed by the storyboard animation mechanisms. At the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> level, no validation is performed to make sure that the steps of the path connect at all. For instance, you can construct a property path that has <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BackgroundProperty?displayProperty=fullName> as the first step, and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FlowDirectionProperty?displayProperty=fullName> as the second step. But such a property path would fail if actually applied as a target, because the Brush type that fills <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BackgroundProperty?displayProperty=fullName> does not have a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FlowDirection%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.
