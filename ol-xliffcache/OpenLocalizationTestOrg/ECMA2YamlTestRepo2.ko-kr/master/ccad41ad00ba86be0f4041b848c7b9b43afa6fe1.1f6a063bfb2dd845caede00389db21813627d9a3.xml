Unlike the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> class, the application writer needs to specifically call the <xref:System.Transactions.CommittableTransaction.Commit%2A> and <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Rollback%2A> methods in order to commit or abort the transaction. However, only the creator of a transaction can commit the transaction. Therefore, copies of a committable transaction, obtained through the <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Clone%2A> method are not committable.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is recommended that you create implicit transactions using the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> class, so that the ambient transaction context is automatically managed for you. You should also use the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> and <xref:System.Transactions.DependentTransaction> class for applications that require the use of the same transaction across multiple function calls or multiple thread calls. For more information on this model, see the [Implementing An Implicit Transaction Using Transaction Scope](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1ddba95e-7587-48b2-8838-708c275e7199) topic.  \\n  \\n Creating a CommittableTransaction does not automatically set the ambient transaction, which is the transaction your code executes in. You can get or set the ambient transaction by calling the static <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Current%2A> property of the global <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction> object. For more information on ambient transactions, see the \\\" Managing Transaction Flow using TransactionScopeOption\\\" section of the [Implementing An Implicit Transaction Using Transaction Scope](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1ddba95e-7587-48b2-8838-708c275e7199) topic. If the ambient transaction is not set, any operation on a resource manager is not part of that transaction. You need to explicitly set and reset the ambient transaction, to ensure that resource managers operate under the right transaction context.  \\n  \\n Until a CommittableTransaction has been committed, all the resources involved with the transaction are still locked.  \\n  \\n A CommittableTransaction object cannot be reused. Once it has been committed or rolled back, it cannot be used again in a transaction or set as the current ambient transaction context.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following sample creates two new instances of CommittableTransaction, commits and rolls back them respectively.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[XpsCreate#XpsCreateAddPkgContent](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/XpsCreate/XpsCreate.cs#xpscreateaddpkgcontent)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public sealed class CommittableTransaction : System.Transactions.Transaction, IAsyncResult'\n  inheritance:\n  -
