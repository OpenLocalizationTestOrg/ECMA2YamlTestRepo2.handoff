You can add a UserTrackPoint to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.UserTrackPoints%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to instruct the runtime tracking infrastructure to send a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingRecord> to the tracking service when the track point is matched. The user data is returned in <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingRecord.UserData%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. A single UserTrackPoint may be matched at multiple points in the workflow instance.  \\n  \\n A <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation> contains match conditions for a location associated with a user event in the potential execution path of a workflow instance. You can add <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation> objects to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint.MatchingLocations%2A> to define locations that should be included in matching for the track point. Similarly, you can add <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation> objects to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint.ExcludedLocations%2A> to define locations that should be excluded from matching for the track point.  \\n  \\n You can add <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.ActivityDataTrackingExtract> objects and <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowDataTrackingExtract> objects to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint.Extracts%2A> to specify data that should be extracted from the workflow instance when the track point is matched. The extracted data will be returned in <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingRecord.Body%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \\n  \\n You can add to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint.Annotations%2A> to specify additional information associated with the track point. These annotations will be returned in <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint.Annotations%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \\n  \\n For an example of how to use this class, see the [Tracking Using User Track Points Sample](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d894a18a-a4c6-467e-9a42-8be025ecd4d5).\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Obsolete(\"The System.Workflow.* types are deprecated.
