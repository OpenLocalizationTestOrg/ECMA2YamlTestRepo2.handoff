Based on <xref:System.Xaml.XamlNodeType>, WriteNode calls into the `Write` virtual members that are dedicated to particular node types.  \\n  \\n If you have an advanced XAML writing scenario that expands the XAML type system and XAML node stream concept so that new node types are defined, do not use WriteNode calls in your logic. You must instead provide your own alternative for node-type switching logic in the class or in virtual overrides.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public void WriteNode (System.Xaml.XamlReader reader);\n
