nameWithType: Keyboard\n  fullName: System.Windows.Input.Keyboard\n  type: Class\n  summary: Represents the keyboard device.\n  remarks: \"The Keyboard class provides keyboard-related events, methods, and properties that provide information regarding the state of the keyboard.  \\n  \\n Each of the events that Keyboard defines as an attached event is also re-exposed by the base element classes <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> and <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> as a new routed event. Generally, it is more convenient to handle keyboard events for an application on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> and <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement>, rather than using the Keyboard events. For details, see [Input Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n In order for an element to receive keyboard input, the element must be focusable. Most <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> derived objects are focusable by default. Otherwise, to make an element focusable, set the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> property on the base element to `true`.  For more information on the base elements, see [Base Elements Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> classes, such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>, set the default value of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> to `false`. Therefore, for these objects to obtain keyboard focus, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> must be set to `true`.  \\n  \\n Keyboard focus refers to the object that is receiving keyboard input. The element with keyboard focus has <xref:System.Windows.IInputElement.IsKeyboardFocused%2A> set to `true`.  There can be only one element with keyboard focus on the entire desktop.  Logical focus refers to the object within a focus scope that has focus.  For more information on focus, keyboard focus, and logical focus, see [Input Overview](../Topic/Input%20Overview.md) and [Focus Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n The static members of the Keyboard class delegate to the primary <xref:System.Windows.Input.KeyboardDevice> of the calling thread, so they are not necessarily thread-safe.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Keyboard.IsKeyToggled%2A> method to determine if a key is in the toggled state. If the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Key> passed to <xref:System.Windows.Input.Keyboard.IsKeyToggled%2A> is toggled, the background of a button is changed.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[keyargssnippetsample#KeyEventArgsKeyBoardIsToggled](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/KeyArgsSnippetSample/Window1.xaml.cs#keyeventargskeyboardistoggled)]\\n [!code-vb[keyargssnippetsample#KeyEventArgsKeyBoardIsToggled](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/keyargssnippetsample/window1.xaml.vb#keyeventargskeyboardistoggled)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public static class Keyboard\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Input.Keyboard.AddGotKeyboardFocusHandler(System.Windows.DependencyObject,System.Windows.Input.KeyboardFocusChangedEventHandler)\n  id: AddGotKeyboardFocusHandler(System.Windows.DependencyObject,System.Windows.Input.KeyboardFocusChangedEventHandler)\n  parent: System.Windows.Input.Keyboard\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AddGotKeyboardFocusHandler(DependencyObject,KeyboardFocusChangedEventHandler)\n  nameWithType: Keyboard.AddGotKeyboardFocusHandler(DependencyObject,KeyboardFocusChangedEventHandler)\n  fullName: System.Windows.Input.Keyboard.AddGotKeyboardFocusHandler(DependencyObject,KeyboardFocusChangedEventHandler)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationCore\n  namespace: System.Windows.Input\n  summary: Adds a handler for the &lt;xref:System.Windows.Input.Keyboard.GotKeyboardFocus?displayProperty=fullName&gt;
