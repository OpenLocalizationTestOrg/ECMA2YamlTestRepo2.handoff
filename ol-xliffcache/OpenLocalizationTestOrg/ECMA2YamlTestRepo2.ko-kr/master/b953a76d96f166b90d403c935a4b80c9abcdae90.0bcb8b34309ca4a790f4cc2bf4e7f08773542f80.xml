Content can be any [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] object or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_html](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-html-md.md)] file. In general, however, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> object is the preferred way to package content for navigation.       Content can be navigated to by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Source%2A> property with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for the desired content.

See <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.FragmentNavigation>.       Alternatively, content can be navigated to by using one of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%2A> method overloads that accepts an object:      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%28System.Object%29>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%29>       The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigating>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigated>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.NavigationProgress>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.NavigationFailed>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.NavigationStopped>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.LoadCompleted>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.FragmentNavigation>.       Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).       The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events will fire:       ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \"Page navigation flow chart\")       During or after a navigation, NavigationWindow provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.Content%2A>).       When content is navigated to, NavigationWindow records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively.       The first time that one piece of content is navigated to from another piece of content, NavigationWindow automatically displays a navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] that allows users to navigate back and forwards through navigation history. You can configure when the navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] is shown by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.ShowsNavigationUI%2A> property.       The most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.       NavigationWindow does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, NavigationWindow creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a piece of state for a piece of content in navigation history.       Using <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.       NavigationWindow is one of two navigators in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)], the other being <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>. Essentially, navigator is a class supports navigation and navigation history. Visually, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] use [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] as a navigator, to provide an integrated user experience. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] actually use NavigationWindow as the navigator; the <xref:System.Windows.Application.MainWindow%2A> property of an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] running in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] will return a reference to the NavigationWindow, and the navigation history that is managed by the NavigationWindow is integrated with the navigation history that is managed by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)].       **Content Model:**  NavigationWindow is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>, which means that NavigationWindow can contain content such as text, images, or panels. Also, NavigationWindow is a root element and, consequently, cannot be part of another element's content. For more information about the content model for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>, see [WPF Content Model](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).      ## Customizing the NavigationWindow Control    To apply the same property settings to multiple NavigationWindow controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the NavigationWindow, see [NavigationWindow Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).      > [!NOTE] >  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in NavigationWindow control's default template and is set by using a .

In general, however, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> object is the preferred way to package content for navigation.  \\n  \\n Content can be navigated to by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Source%2A> property with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for the desired content. Additionally, content can be navigated to by using one of the following overloads of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%2A> method:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%28System.Uri%29>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%29>  \\n  \\n When content is navigated to by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], NavigationWindow will return an object that contains the content.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Navigation by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] also supports navigation to a content fragment. See <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.FragmentNavigation>.  \\n  \\n Alternatively, content can be navigated to by using one of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%2A> method overloads that accepts an object:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%28System.Object%29>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%29>  \\n  \\n The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigating>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigated>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.NavigationProgress>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.NavigationFailed>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.NavigationStopped>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.LoadCompleted>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.FragmentNavigation>.  \\n  \\n Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).  \\n  \\n The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events will fire:  \\n  \\n ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \\\"Page navigation flow chart\\\")  \\n  \\n During or after a navigation, NavigationWindow provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.Content%2A>).  \\n  \\n When content is navigated to, NavigationWindow records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively.  \\n  \\n The first time that one piece of content is navigated to from another piece of content, NavigationWindow automatically displays a navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] that allows users to navigate back and forwards through navigation history. You can configure when the navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] is shown by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.ShowsNavigationUI%2A> property.  \\n  \\n The most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.  \\n  \\n NavigationWindow does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, NavigationWindow creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a piece of state for a piece of content in navigation history.  \\n  \\n Using <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.  \\n  \\n NavigationWindow is one of two navigators in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)], the other being <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>. Essentially, navigator is a class supports navigation and navigation history. Visually, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] use [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] as a navigator, to provide an integrated user experience. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] actually use NavigationWindow as the navigator; the <xref:System.Windows.Application.MainWindow%2A> property of an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] running in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] will return a reference to the NavigationWindow, and the navigation history that is managed by the NavigationWindow is integrated with the navigation history that is managed by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)].  \\n  \\n **Content Model:**  NavigationWindow is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>, which means that NavigationWindow can contain content such as text, images, or panels. Also, NavigationWindow is a root element and, consequently, cannot be part of another element's content. For more information about the content model for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>, see [WPF Content Model](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n## Customizing the NavigationWindow Control  \\n To apply the same property settings to multiple NavigationWindow controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the NavigationWindow, see [NavigationWindow Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application.
