The runtime tracking infrastructure uses a TrackingProfile to filter these tracking events and returns tracking records based on this filtering to a tracking service. There are three kinds of tracking events that can be filtered: activity status events, workflow status events, and user events. You can add <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.ActivityTrackPoint> objects to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.ActivityTrackPoints%2A> property to match specific activity status events; <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackPoint> objects to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.WorkflowTrackPoints%2A> property to match specific workflow status events; and  <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint> objects to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.UserTrackPoints%2A> property to match specific user events. When a track point is matched, the runtime tracking infrastructure returns the data associated with the tracking event to the tracking service over the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingChannel> associated with that service. The data is returned in either an <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.ActivityTrackingRecord>, a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord>, or a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingRecord> depending on the type of track point that was matched.       A tracking service implements the methods in the abstract <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingService> class to provide the functionality for the runtime tracking infrastructure to request a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingChannel> associated with the service, and a TrackingProfile associated with a particular workflow instance or with a particular workflow type. A tracking service must also implement the abstract <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingChannel> class to provide the channel over which the runtime tracking infrastructure can send tracking records.       When the tracking service returns a tracking profile object to the runtime, the workflow starts to execute, and the tracking profile is serialized. If the serialization of the tracking profile fails, an exception is raised to the workflow instance. If the exception is not handled, the workflow instance is terminated. The tracking profile can be validated before passing it to the runtime using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfileSerializer.Schema%2A> property.       A TrackingProfile can be serialized to XML by using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfileSerializer>, which formats the XML according to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfileSerializer.Schema%2A>. This provides a convenient format for profile storage and for authoring a profile in a non-programmatic manner. For example, the SQL Tracking Service stores serialized versions of its tracking profiles, as will any tracking service you create based on the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.SqlTrackingService> class.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"extradata":"MT","nodes":[{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&gt;

The runtime tracking infrastructure uses a TrackingProfile to filter these tracking events and returns tracking records based on this filtering to a tracking service. There are three kinds of tracking events that can be filtered: activity status events, workflow status events, and user events. You can add <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.ActivityTrackPoint> objects to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.ActivityTrackPoints%2A> property to match specific activity status events; <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackPoint> objects to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.WorkflowTrackPoints%2A> property to match specific workflow status events; and  <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint> objects to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.UserTrackPoints%2A> property to match specific user events. When a track point is matched, the runtime tracking infrastructure returns the data associated with the tracking event to the tracking service over the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingChannel> associated with that service. The data is returned in either an <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.ActivityTrackingRecord>, a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord>, or a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingRecord> depending on the type of track point that was matched.  \\n  \\n A tracking service implements the methods in the abstract <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingService> class to provide the functionality for the runtime tracking infrastructure to request a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingChannel> associated with the service, and a TrackingProfile associated with a particular workflow instance or with a particular workflow type. A tracking service must also implement the abstract <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingChannel> class to provide the channel over which the runtime tracking infrastructure can send tracking records.  \\n  \\n When the tracking service returns a tracking profile object to the runtime, the workflow starts to execute, and the tracking profile is serialized. If the serialization of the tracking profile fails, an exception is raised to the workflow instance. If the exception is not handled, the workflow instance is terminated. The tracking profile can be validated before passing it to the runtime using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfileSerializer.Schema%2A> property.  \\n  \\n A TrackingProfile can be serialized to XML by using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfileSerializer>, which formats the XML according to the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfileSerializer.Schema%2A>. This provides a convenient format for profile storage and for authoring a profile in a non-programmatic manner. For example, the SQL Tracking Service stores serialized versions of its tracking profiles, as will any tracking service you create based on the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.SqlTrackingService> class.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how you can create a TrackingProfile using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile.%23ctor%2A> constructor and use the object's properties to help track the execution of a workflow.
