Parameters default to the following maximum lengths.      |Parameter|Maximum length|   |---------------|--------------------|   |`username`|64 characters if using the `userPrincipalName` attribute. If using the `sAMAccountName` attribute, the common restriction is 20 characters or less.|   |`password`|128 characters.|   |`email`|256 characters.|   |`passwordQuestion`|256 characters.|   |`passwordAnswer`|128 characters before and after encrypting.|       The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser.Comment%2A> property on the returned <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser> instance is limited to 1024 characters.       If the directory schema has been modified by reducing the maximum allowable lengths for these attributes, these lengths will take precedence.       Before creating the user, the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class will make sure the user name is unique. If the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> instance is configured to require unique e-mail addresses, it will also make sure the e-mail address is unique.       In an Active Directory user-name uniqueness is enforced by performing a GC search when the user name is mapped to `userPrincipalName`. If `sAMAccountName` is used, then the directory will automatically enforce uniqueness of the `sAMAccountName` across the Active Directory domain.       An ADAM server will automatically enforce user name uniqueness of the `userPrincipalName` across all application partitions.       Uniqueness of the e-mail address is enforced by performing a subtree search for a duplicate e-mail address starting at the root of the container in which users are created. This is either the default user container (if connected to an Active Directory and no container was specified in the connection string) or the container specified in the connection string.       The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class creates the user directly in the user container specified in the connection string. See the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class topic for more information about connection strings.       For passwords to be set on an Active Directory server, the `connectionProtection` attribute must be set to <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryConnectionProtection>.       When an ADAM server is being used, the `connectionProtection` attribute can be set to <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryConnectionProtection>, but only if you explicitly configure the ADAM server to allow password changes over unsecured connections.       Leading and trailing spaces are trimmed from all string parameter values except `password`.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  You cannot create new users unless the credentials used to connect to the Active Directory server have either Domain Administrator rights (not recommended) or the \"create child instance,\" \"delete child instance,\" and \"set password\" access rights.

For more information, see the ADAM Configuration section below.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider instance works only in the full-trust policy default configuration of ASP.NET. In order to use the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider instance at any partial-trust level, either you must make changes to the appropriate trust policy file for your application or you must create a \\\"sandbox\\\" assembly that is deployed in the GAC.  \\n>   \\n>  The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class requires unrestricted <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission to run. This permission is not added to any of the partial-trust policy files supplied with ASP.NET. Although adding the <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission to a partial-trust policy file will enable use of the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class, doing so makes the <xref:System.DirectoryServices> namespace classes available to any code running in your ASP.NET pages. This option is not recommended for any Web servers that need to run in a secure, locked-down mode.  \\n>   \\n>  As an alternative, you can create a \\\"sandbox\\\" assembly that calls the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class. This assembly can contain either a wrapper class that forwards method calls to the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class or a class that derives from the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class. In either case, the wrapper class must assert unrestricted <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission. Deploy the sandbox assembly in the GAC and mark the assembly with the <xref:System.Security.AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute> (APTCA) attribute. This will enable your partially trusted ASP.NET code to call your wrapper class, and since the wrapper class internally asserts the unrestricted <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission, your wrapper class will be able to successfully call the provider  \\n  \\n You must create a [connectionStrings Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b6ffbb2e-a4d1-410e-8f7e-9755e92c65de) entry in the Web.config file that identifies the Active Directory server, Active Directory domain, or ADAM application partition to use. The provider will only operate at domain scope, or in a subscope within a domain. The following table lists allowed connection strings and the scope used.  \\n  \\n|Connection string|Scope|  \\n|-----------------------|-----------|  \\n|LDAP://\\\\<domain or server>:[port]<br /><br /> Port number is optional for ADAM and not needed for Active Directory.|The provider runs against the specified domain or server.

The `connectionProtection` attribute also determines the methods the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider instance will use to create the connection to the Active Directory or ADAM server.  \\n  \\n The following table shows the effect of the `connectionProtection` attribute when connecting to an Active Directory.  \\n  \\n|`connectionProtection` setting|Effect|  \\n|------------------------------------|------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryConnectionProtection>|The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class will connect to an Active Directory, with these restrictions.<br /><br /> -   Any method that sets a password will fail. Active Directory requires a secure connection when changing passwords.<br />-   You must explicitly set the `connectionUsername` and `connectionPassword` attributes using the [add Element for providers for membership (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8423ec7f-a06d-4606-977e-a46400b2fc18) in the application configuration file; otherwise, the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider instance will throw a <xref:System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderException> exception.|  \\n|`Secure`|The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class will attempt to connect to Active Directory using SSL. If SSL fails, a second attempt to connect to Active Directory using sign-and-seal will be made. If both attempts fail, the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider instance will throw a <xref:System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderException> exception.<br /><br /> Both process credentials and explicit credentials are supported.|  \\n  \\n The following table shows the effect of the `connectionProtection` attribute when connecting to an ADAM server.  \\n  \\n|`connectionProtection` setting|Effect|  \\n|------------------------------------|------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryConnectionProtection>|The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class will connect to an ADAM server, with this restriction.<br /><br /> -   Any method that sets passwords will fail unless you explicitly configure the ADAM server to allow passwords to be sent and changed over an insecure connection.<br /><br /> Both process credentials and explicit credentials are supported.|  \\n|`Secure`|The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class will attempt to connect to the ADAM server using SSL. If a connection cannot be made, the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider instance will throw a <xref:System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderException> exception.<br /><br /> Both process credentials and explicit credentials are supported.|  \\n  \\n## ADAM Configuration  \\n When using an ADAM server, the ADAM instance must contain a schema that defines the `User` class. You can import the `User` class with an LDIF import of the `MS-User.ldf` file available in the ADAM install directory.  \\n  \\n The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class will work with an ADAM server configured to use the default network ports.
