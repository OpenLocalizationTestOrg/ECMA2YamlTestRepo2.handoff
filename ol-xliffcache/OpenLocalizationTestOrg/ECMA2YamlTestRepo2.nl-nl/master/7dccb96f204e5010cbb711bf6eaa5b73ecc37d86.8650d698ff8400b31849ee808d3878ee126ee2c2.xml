For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n The first part of the example contains the code for the custom control, named `TextDisplayWebPart`. Because the control derives from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart>, it also inherits the common properties that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> class provides, including the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part.ChromeState%2A> property, which uses the PartChromeState enumeration as its return type.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_Part_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_229_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_Part_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_229_1.cs)]  \\n  \\n Note that in the declarative markup for the Web page, the second instance of the `TextDisplayWebPart` control sets its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part.ChromeState%2A> property.
