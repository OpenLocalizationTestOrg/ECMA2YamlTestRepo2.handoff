This class is called by the install utility when installing a service application.\n  remarks: \"The ServiceInstaller does work specific to the service with which it is associated. It is used by the installation utility to write registry values associated with the service to a subkey within the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services registry key. The service is identified by its ServiceName within this subkey. The subkey also includes the name of the executable or .dll to which the service belongs.  \\n  \\n To install a service, create a project installer class that inherits from the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer> class, and set the <xref:System.ComponentModel.RunInstallerAttribute> attribute on the class to `true`. Within your project, create one <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> instance per service application, and one ServiceInstaller instance for each service in the application. Within your project installer class constructor, set the installation properties for the service using the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> and ServiceInstaller instances, and add the instances to the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer.Installers%2A> collection.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is recommended that you use the constructor for adding installer instances; however, if you need to add to the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer.Installers%2A> collection in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Install%2A> method, be sure to perform the same additions to the collection in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Uninstall%2A> method.  \\n  \\n For all classes deriving from the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer> class, the state of the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer.Installers%2A> collection must be the same in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Install%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Uninstall%2A> methods. However, you can avoid the maintenance of the collection across the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Install%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Uninstall%2A> methods if you add installer instances to the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer.Installers%2A> collection in your custom installer class constructor.When the install utility is called, it looks for the <xref:System.ComponentModel.RunInstallerAttribute> attribute. If the attribute is `true`, the utility installs all the services that were added to the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer.Installers%2A> collection that were associated with your project installer. If <xref:System.ComponentModel.RunInstallerAttribute> is `false` or does not exist, the install utility ignores the project installer.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> associated with your project installation class installs information common to all ServiceInstaller instances in the project. If this service has anything that separates it from the other services in the installation project, that service-specific information is installed by this method.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is crucial that the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.ServiceName%2A> be identical to the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.ServiceName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> of the class you derived from <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase>. Normally, the value of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.ServiceName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property for the service is set within the Main() function of the service application's executable. The Service Control Manager uses the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.ServiceName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to locate the service within this executable.  \\n  \\n You can modify other properties on the ServiceInstaller either before or after adding it to the <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer.Installers%2A> collection of your project installer. For example, a service's <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.StartType%2A> may be set to start the service automatically at reboot or require a user to start the service manually.  \\n  \\n Normally, you will not call the methods on ServiceInstaller within your code; they are generally called only by the install utility. The install utility automatically calls the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller.Install%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Install%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods during the installation process. It backs out failures, if necessary, by calling <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller.Rollback%2A> (or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Rollback%2A?displayProperty=fullName>) on all previously installed components.  \\n  \\n The installation utility calls <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Uninstall%2A> to remove the object.  \\n  \\n An application's install routine maintains information automatically about the components already installed, using the project installer's <xref:System.Configuration.Install.Installer.Context%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. This state information is continuously updated as the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> instance, and each ServiceInstaller instance is installed by the utility. It is usually unnecessary for your code to modify state information explicitly.  \\n  \\n When the installation is performed, it automatically creates an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> to install the event log source associated with the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> derived class. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property for this source is set by the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.%23ctor%2A> constructor to the computer's Application log. When you set the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.ServiceName%2A> of the ServiceInstaller (which should be identical to the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.ServiceName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> of the service), the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> is automatically set to the same value. In an installation failure, the source's installation is rolled-back along with previously installed services.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.Uninstall%2A> method tries to stop the service if it is running.

It is assumed there is a service executable that contains two services, \\\"Hello-World Service 1\\\" and \\\"Hello-World Service 2\\\". Within the constructor for `MyProjectInstaller` (which would be called by the install utility), ServiceInstaller objects are created for each of these services, and a <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> is created for the executable.
