In addition to the standard record-oriented features, it provides a policy model for avoiding log-full conditions, and multiplexing of clients on the same physical file. It works with the <xref:System.IO.Log.LogStore> class, which provides an interface for directly manipulating and managing a CLFS log file. The relationship between the <xref:System.IO.Log.LogStore> class and the LogRecordSequence class is similar to the relationship between a disk file and a <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object. The disk file provides the concrete storage, and has attributes such as length and last access time; while the <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object provides a view on the file that can be used to read from it and write to it. Similarly, the <xref:System.IO.Log.LogStore> class has attributes like a policy and a collection of disk extents; and the LogRecordSequence class provides a record-oriented mechanism for reading and writing data.\n  example:\n  - \"This example shows how to use the LogRecordSequence class:  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[S_UELogRecordSequence#0](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.io.log.logrecor_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[S_UELogRecordSequence#0](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.io.log.logrecor_1.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public sealed class LogRecordSequence : IDisposable, System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence'\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements:\n  - System.IDisposable\n  - System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.IO.Log.LogRecordSequence.#ctor(System.IO.Log.LogStore)\n  id: '#ctor(System.IO.Log.LogStore)'\n  parent: System.IO.Log.LogRecordSequence\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: LogRecordSequence(LogStore)\n  nameWithType: LogRecordSequence.LogRecordSequence(LogStore)\n  fullName: System.IO.Log.LogRecordSequence.LogRecordSequence(LogStore)\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.IO.Log\n  namespace: System.IO.Log\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.IO.Log.LogRecordSequence\"></xref> class with the specified log store.\n  remarks: The buffer size determines the maximum size of the record that can be appended or read.
