For details about Web Parts connections, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> and [Web Parts Connections Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       The WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class passes event data to methods that use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventHandler> delegate to handle events.

In the custom handler method, developers can access the details of a connection by using the WebPartConnectionsEventArgs object that is passed to the method as a parameter.

To form a connection, the two controls must reside in a zone that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class (such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control), and they must be designed correctly to share data through a common interface. For details about Web Parts connections, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> and [Web Parts Connections Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n The WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class passes event data to methods that use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventHandler> delegate to handle events. There are two such connection-related methods that raise events and use the WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class to provide event data. Both are members of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsConnected%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> event after two server controls have successfully connected, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsDisconnected%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> event after two server controls have been disconnected.  \\n  \\n Developers can create custom event handler methods for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> events, and in those methods, they can use the WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class to access details of a connection. For example, a developer can declare the `OnWebPartsConnected` attribute on the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and assign to it a custom method name that will handle the event. In the custom handler method, developers can access the details of a connection by using the WebPartConnectionsEventArgs object that is passed to the method as a parameter.  \\n  \\n The WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class has two overloads of the constructor.

The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Connection%2A> property refers to the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> object that represents the entire connection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Provider%2A> property references a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server control acting as the provider in the connection, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Consumer%2A> property references a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control acting as the consumer.
