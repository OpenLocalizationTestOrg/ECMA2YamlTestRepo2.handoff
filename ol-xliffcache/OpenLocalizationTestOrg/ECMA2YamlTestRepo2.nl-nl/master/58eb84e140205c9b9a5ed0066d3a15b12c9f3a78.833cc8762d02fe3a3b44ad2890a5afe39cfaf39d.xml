It is through XML Web services discovery that XML Web service clients learn about the available XML Web services at a given URL and how to use them. XML Web services discovery works from the premise that you have already obtained the URL to a discovery document, possibly through a directory service, such as http://uddi.microsoft.com, however, you do not have the details about the XML Web services offered. Through XML Web services discovery, you can discover the details about the XML Web services listed in a <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryDocument> at a specific URL.       An XML Web service client starts XML Web services discovery by supplying a URL to either the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.Discover%2A> or <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.DiscoverAny%2A> methods. Typically, this URL refers to a discovery document, which in turn refers to documents that describe one or more XML Web services, which are added to the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.References%2A> property. At that point, only that document is downloaded and verified to point to valid information about XML Web services. However, the references contained in that document are not verified at this stage.

It is through XML Web services discovery that XML Web service clients learn about the available XML Web services at a given URL and how to use them. XML Web services discovery works from the premise that you have already obtained the URL to a discovery document, possibly through a directory service, such as http://uddi.microsoft.com, however, you do not have the details about the XML Web services offered. Through XML Web services discovery, you can discover the details about the XML Web services listed in a <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryDocument> at a specific URL.  \\n  \\n An XML Web service client starts XML Web services discovery by supplying a URL to either the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.Discover%2A> or <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.DiscoverAny%2A> methods. Typically, this URL refers to a discovery document, which in turn refers to documents that describe one or more XML Web services, which are added to the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.References%2A> property. At that point, only that document is downloaded and verified to point to valid information about XML Web services. However, the references contained in that document are not verified at this stage. Instead they are added to the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.References%2A> property. To verify that the references are valid, invoke the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.ResolveAll%2A> or <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.ResolveOneLevel%2A> methods, which add valid referenced documents to the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.Documents%2A> property. Last, if a client wants to save the discovery results to disk, invoke the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.WriteAll%2A> method.  \\n  \\n If programmatic access to XML Web services discovery is not needed, the [!INCLUDE[winsdklong](~/add/includes/winsdklong-md.md)] ships the Web Services Discovery tool (Disco.exe) for discovering XML Web services within a command prompt. For more details, see [Web Services Discovery Tool (Disco.exe)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/acd88078-c581-42bc-94ca-6633e2851979).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example is a Web Form demonstrating how to use the DiscoveryClientProtocol class together with the other classes in the <xref:System.Web.Services.Discovery> namespace to programmatically invoke XML Web services discovery.
