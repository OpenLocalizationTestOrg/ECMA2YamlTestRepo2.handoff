You can store a collection of values referenced by a key name or by numerical index. Access to session values and functionality is available using the HttpSessionState class, which is accessible through the <xref:System.Web.HttpContext.Session%2A> property of the current <xref:System.Web.HttpContext>, or the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.Session%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page>.       Session data is associated with a specific browser session using a unique identifier. By default, this identifier is stored in a non-expiring session cookie in the browser, but you can also configure your application to store the session identifier in the URL by setting the `cookieless` attribute to `true` or <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> in the  element of your application configuration. You can have ASP.NET determine whether cookies are supported by the browser by specifying a value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> for the `cookieless` attribute. You can also have ASP.NET determine whether cookies are enabled for the browser by specifying a value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> for the `cookieless` attribute. If cookies are supported when <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> is specified, or enabled when <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> is specified, then the session identifier will be stored in a cookie; otherwise the session identifier will be stored in the URL.       Sessions are started during the first request and session values will persist as long as a new request is made by the browser before the number of minutes specified in the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.Timeout%2A> property pass. When a new session begins, the session <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule.Start> event is raised. You can use this event to perform any additional work at the start of a session, such as setting default session values. When a session times out, the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.Abandon%2A> method is called, or the ASP.NET application is shut down, the session <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule.End> event is raised. You can use this event to perform any necessary cleanup. The <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule.End> event is raised only when the session state `mode` is set to <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateMode>.       To improve performance, sessions that use cookies do not allocate session storage until data is actually stored in the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.Session%2A> object. For more information, see the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.SessionID%2A> property.       Session state does not persist across ASP.NET application boundaries. If a browser navigates to another application, the session information is not available to the new application.       Session values are stored in memory on the Web server, by default. You can also store session values in a SQL Server database, an ASP.NET state server, or a custom server. This enables you to preserve session values in cases where the ASP.NET or IIS process or the ASP.NET application restarts and to make session values available across all the servers in a Web farm. This behavior is configured by setting the `mode` attribute to a valid <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateMode> value in the  element of your application configuration. For more information, see [Session-State Modes](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).

By default, the unique identifier for a session is stored in a non-expiring session cookie in the browser. You can specify that session identifiers not be stored in a cookie by setting the `cookieless` attribute to `true` in the  configuration element.      > [!NOTE] >  To improve the security of your application, your application should allow users to log out, at which point it should call the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.Abandon%2A> method. This reduces the potential for an unwanted source using the unique identifier in the URL to retrieve private data stored in the session for a user.       ASP.NET maintains cookieless session state by automatically inserting a unique session ID into the page's URL. For example, the following URL has been modified by ASP.NET to include the unique session ID lit3py55t21z5v55vlm25s55:      ```   http://www.example.com/(S(4danlfat035muve4g0mvgfrr))/orderform.aspx   ```       ASP.NET modifies the links contained in all requested pages by embedding a session-ID value in the links just before sending each page to the browser. Session state is maintained as long as the user follows the path of links that the site provides. However, if the user agent rewrites a URL, the session-state instance will be lost.       The session ID is embedded in the URL after the slash that follows the application name and before any remaining file or virtual-directory identifier. This allows ASP.NET to resolve the application name before involving the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule> in the request.       By default, session identifiers used in cookieless sessions are recycled. That is, if a request is made with a session ID that has expired, a new session is started using the session ID supplied with the request. This behavior can result in the unwanted sharing of session data when a link that contains a cookieless session ID is shared with multiple browsers, perhaps through a search engine or other program. You can reduce the possibility of session data being shared by multiple clients by disabling the recycling of session identifiers. To do this, set the `regenerateExpiredSessionId` attribute of the  configuration element to `true`.

You can store a collection of values referenced by a key name or by numerical index. Access to session values and functionality is available using the HttpSessionState class, which is accessible through the <xref:System.Web.HttpContext.Session%2A> property of the current <xref:System.Web.HttpContext>, or the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.Session%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page>.  \\n  \\n Session data is associated with a specific browser session using a unique identifier. By default, this identifier is stored in a non-expiring session cookie in the browser, but you can also configure your application to store the session identifier in the URL by setting the `cookieless` attribute to `true` or <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> in the  element of your application configuration. You can have ASP.NET determine whether cookies are supported by the browser by specifying a value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> for the `cookieless` attribute. You can also have ASP.NET determine whether cookies are enabled for the browser by specifying a value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> for the `cookieless` attribute. If cookies are supported when <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> is specified, or enabled when <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> is specified, then the session identifier will be stored in a cookie; otherwise the session identifier will be stored in the URL.  \\n  \\n Sessions are started during the first request and session values will persist as long as a new request is made by the browser before the number of minutes specified in the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.Timeout%2A> property pass. When a new session begins, the session <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule.Start> event is raised. You can use this event to perform any additional work at the start of a session, such as setting default session values. When a session times out, the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.Abandon%2A> method is called, or the ASP.NET application is shut down, the session <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule.End> event is raised. You can use this event to perform any necessary cleanup. The <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule.End> event is raised only when the session state `mode` is set to <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateMode>.  \\n  \\n To improve performance, sessions that use cookies do not allocate session storage until data is actually stored in the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.Session%2A> object. For more information, see the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.SessionID%2A> property.  \\n  \\n Session state does not persist across ASP.NET application boundaries. If a browser navigates to another application, the session information is not available to the new application.  \\n  \\n Session values are stored in memory on the Web server, by default. You can also store session values in a SQL Server database, an ASP.NET state server, or a custom server. This enables you to preserve session values in cases where the ASP.NET or IIS process or the ASP.NET application restarts and to make session values available across all the servers in a Web farm. This behavior is configured by setting the `mode` attribute to a valid <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateMode> value in the  element of your application configuration. For more information, see [Session-State Modes](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Alternatives to session state include application state (see the <xref:System.Web.HttpApplication.Application%2A> property) and the ASP.NET cache (see the <xref:System.Web.Caching> namespace), which store variables that can be accessed by all users of an ASP.NET application; the ASP.NET profile (see the <xref:System.Web.Profile> namespace), which persists user values in a data store without expiring them using a time-out; ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls?displayProperty=fullName>, which persist control values in the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ViewState%2A>; <xref:System.Web.HttpResponse.Cookies%2A>; the <xref:System.Web.HttpRequest.QueryString%2A> property; and fields on an HTML form that are available from an HTTP `POST` using the <xref:System.Web.HttpRequest.Form%2A> collection.

By default, the unique identifier for a session is stored in a non-expiring session cookie in the browser. You can specify that session identifiers not be stored in a cookie by setting the `cookieless` attribute to `true` in the  configuration element.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To improve the security of your application, your application should allow users to log out, at which point it should call the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.Abandon%2A> method. This reduces the potential for an unwanted source using the unique identifier in the URL to retrieve private data stored in the session for a user.  \\n  \\n ASP.NET maintains cookieless session state by automatically inserting a unique session ID into the page's URL. For example, the following URL has been modified by ASP.NET to include the unique session ID lit3py55t21z5v55vlm25s55:  \\n  \\n```  \\nhttp://www.example.com/(S(4danlfat035muve4g0mvgfrr))/orderform.aspx  \\n```  \\n  \\n ASP.NET modifies the links contained in all requested pages by embedding a session-ID value in the links just before sending each page to the browser. Session state is maintained as long as the user follows the path of links that the site provides. However, if the user agent rewrites a URL, the session-state instance will be lost.  \\n  \\n The session ID is embedded in the URL after the slash that follows the application name and before any remaining file or virtual-directory identifier. This allows ASP.NET to resolve the application name before involving the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule> in the request.  \\n  \\n By default, session identifiers used in cookieless sessions are recycled. That is, if a request is made with a session ID that has expired, a new session is started using the session ID supplied with the request. This behavior can result in the unwanted sharing of session data when a link that contains a cookieless session ID is shared with multiple browsers, perhaps through a search engine or other program. You can reduce the possibility of session data being shared by multiple clients by disabling the recycling of session identifiers. To do this, set the `regenerateExpiredSessionId` attribute of the  configuration element to `true`. This will result in a new session ID being generated when a cookieless session request is made with an expired session ID. Note that if the request made with the expired session ID uses the HTTP `POST` method, then any posted data will be lost when `regenerateExpiredSessionId` is `true`, as ASP.NET performs a redirect to ensure that the browser has the new session identifier in the URL.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  While setting the `regenerateExpiredSessionId` attribute to `true` reduces the possibility of unwanted sharing of session data, it does not protect against an unwanted source gaining access to the session of another user by obtaining the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.SessionID%2A> value and including it in requests to the server.

The SessionID value is randomly generated by ASP.NET and stored in a non-expiring session cookie in the browser. The SessionID value is then sent in a cookie with each request to the ASP.NET application.  \\n  \\n If you want to disable the use of cookies in your ASP.NET application and still make use of session state, you can configure your application to store the session identifier in the URL instead of a cookie by setting the `cookieless` attribute of the  configuration element to `true`, or to <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode>, in the Web.config file for your application. You can have ASP.NET determine whether cookies are supported by the browser by specifying a value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> for the `cookieless` attribute. You can also have ASP.NET determine whether cookies are enabled for the browser by specifying a value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> for the `cookieless` attribute. If cookies are supported when <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> is specified, or enabled when <xref:System.Web.HttpCookieMode> is specified, then the session identifier will be stored in a cookie; otherwise the session identifier will be stored in the URL. For more information, see the <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.IsCookieless%2A> property.  \\n  \\n The SessionID is sent between the server and the browser in clear text, either in a cookie or in the URL. As a result, an unwanted source could gain access to the session of another user by obtaining the SessionID value and including it in requests to the server. If you are storing private or sensitive information in session state, it is recommended that you use SSL to encrypt any communication between the browser and server that includes the SessionID.  \\n  \\n When using cookie-based session state, ASP.NET does not allocate storage for session data until the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.Session%2A> object is used. As a result, a new session ID is generated for each page request until the session object is accessed. If your application requires a static session ID for the entire session, you can either implement the `Session_Start` method in the application's Global.asax file and store data in the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.Session%2A> object to fix the session ID, or you can use code in another part of your application to explicitly store data in the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.Session%2A> object.  \\n  \\n If your application uses cookieless session state, the session ID is generated on the first page view and is maintained for the entire session.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows a Web.config file that configures session state to use cookieless session identifiers.
