For more information about authoring custom controls, see [Developing Custom Windows Forms Controls with the .NET Framework](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       The Control class implements very basic functionality required by classes that display information to the user. It handles user input through the keyboard and pointing devices. It handles message routing and security. It defines the bounds of a control (its position and size), although it does not implement painting. It provides a window handle (`hWnd`).       Windows Forms controls use ambient properties so child controls can appear like their surrounding environment. An *ambient property* is a control property that, if not set, is retrieved from the parent control. If the control does not have a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Parent%2A>, and the property is not set, the control attempts to determine the value of the ambient property through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Site%2A> property. If the control is not sited, if the site does not support ambient properties, or if the property is not set on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AmbientProperties>, the control uses its own default values. Typically, an ambient property represents a characteristic of a control, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>, that is communicated to a child control. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> will have the same <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> as its parent <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> by default. Ambient properties provided by the Controlclass include: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Cursor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ForeColor%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A>.      > [!NOTE] >  To make your Windows Forms application support visual styles, be sure to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle> property to `System` and include a manifest with your executable. A manifest is an XML file that is included either as a resource within your application executable or as a separate file that resides in the same directory as the executable file. For an example of a manifest, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle> enumeration. For more information about using visual styles, see[Visual Styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb773187.aspx).       Windows Forms has accessibility support built in, and provides information about your application that enables it to work with accessibility client applications such as screen enlarger and reviewer utilities, voice input utilities, on-screen keyboards, alternative input devices, and keyboard enhancement utilities. Sometimes you will want to provide additional information to accessibility client applications. There are two ways of providing this additional information. You can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleName%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleDescription%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleDefaultActionDescription%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleRole%2A> property values, which will be reported to accessibility client applications. This method is typically used to provide limited accessibility information for existing controls. Alternatively, you can write your own class deriving from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlAccessibleObject> classes, providing as much accessibility information as needed.      > [!NOTE] >  To maintain better performance, do not set the size of a control in its constructor. The preferred method is to override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DefaultSize%2A> property.      > [!NOTE] >  Do not add data bindings for a Control in its constructor. Doing so will cause errors in code generation and can cause unwanted behavior.       The majority of the controls in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms> namespace use the underlying Windows common control as a base to build on. For more information about the Windows common controls, see[General Control Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775497.aspx).       To identify Windows Forms controls from a separate process, use a standard `SendMessage` call to pass the WM_GETCONTROLNAME message. WM_GETCONTROLNAME is independent of the language and Windows hierarchy. For more information, see the \"Recommended Solution for Windows Forms\" topic in[Automating Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms996405.aspx).       Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.InvokeRequired%2A> property to synchronize access to the control from multiple threads.

Therefore, if you are calling a control's method from a different thread, you must use one of the control's invoke methods to marshal the call to the proper thread. This property can be used to determine if you must call an invoke method, which can be useful if you do not know what thread owns a control.      > [!NOTE] >  In addition to the InvokeRequired property, there are four methods on a control that are thread safe to call: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A>,<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.EndInvoke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A> if the handle for the control has already been created. Calling <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A> before the control's handle has been created on a background thread can cause illegal cross thread calls. For all other method calls, you should use one of these invoke methods when calling from a different thread.       If the control's handle does not yet exist, InvokeRequired searches up the control's parent chain until it finds a control or form that does have a window handle. If no appropriate handle can be found, the InvokeRequired method returns `false`.       This means that InvokeRequiredcan return `false` if <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A> is not required (the call occurs on the same thread), or if the control was created on a different thread but the control's handle has not yet been created.       In the case where the control's handle has not yet been created, you should not simply call properties, methods, or events on the control. This might cause the control's handle to be created on the background thread, isolating the control on a thread without a message pump and making the application unstable.       You can protect against this case by also checking the value of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsHandleCreated%2A> when InvokeRequired returns `false` on a background thread. If the control handle has not yet been created, you must wait until it has been created before calling <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A>. Typically, this happens only if a background thread is created in the constructor of the primary form for the application (as in `Application.Run(new MainForm())`, before the form has been shown or `Application.Run` has been called.       One solution is to wait until the form's handle has been created before starting the background thread. Either force handle creation by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Handle%2A> property, or wait until the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event to start the background process.

csharp\n  name: Control\n  nameWithType: Control\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.Control\n  type: Class\n  summary: Defines the base class for controls, which are components with visual representation.\n  remarks: \"To create your own control class, inherit from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl>, Control classes, or from the other Windows Forms provided controls. For more information about authoring custom controls, see [Developing Custom Windows Forms Controls with the .NET Framework](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n The Control class implements very basic functionality required by classes that display information to the user. It handles user input through the keyboard and pointing devices. It handles message routing and security. It defines the bounds of a control (its position and size), although it does not implement painting. It provides a window handle (`hWnd`).  \\n  \\n Windows Forms controls use ambient properties so child controls can appear like their surrounding environment. An *ambient property* is a control property that, if not set, is retrieved from the parent control. If the control does not have a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Parent%2A>, and the property is not set, the control attempts to determine the value of the ambient property through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Site%2A> property. If the control is not sited, if the site does not support ambient properties, or if the property is not set on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AmbientProperties>, the control uses its own default values. Typically, an ambient property represents a characteristic of a control, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>, that is communicated to a child control. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> will have the same <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> as its parent <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> by default. Ambient properties provided by the Controlclass include: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Cursor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ForeColor%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A>.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To make your Windows Forms application support visual styles, be sure to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle> property to `System` and include a manifest with your executable. A manifest is an XML file that is included either as a resource within your application executable or as a separate file that resides in the same directory as the executable file. For an example of a manifest, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle> enumeration. For more information about using visual styles, see[Visual Styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb773187.aspx).  \\n  \\n Windows Forms has accessibility support built in, and provides information about your application that enables it to work with accessibility client applications such as screen enlarger and reviewer utilities, voice input utilities, on-screen keyboards, alternative input devices, and keyboard enhancement utilities. Sometimes you will want to provide additional information to accessibility client applications. There are two ways of providing this additional information. You can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleName%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleDescription%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleDefaultActionDescription%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleRole%2A> property values, which will be reported to accessibility client applications. This method is typically used to provide limited accessibility information for existing controls. Alternatively, you can write your own class deriving from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlAccessibleObject> classes, providing as much accessibility information as needed.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To maintain better performance, do not set the size of a control in its constructor. The preferred method is to override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DefaultSize%2A> property.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Do not add data bindings for a Control in its constructor. Doing so will cause errors in code generation and can cause unwanted behavior.  \\n  \\n The majority of the controls in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms> namespace use the underlying Windows common control as a base to build on. For more information about the Windows common controls, see[General Control Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775497.aspx).  \\n  \\n To identify Windows Forms controls from a separate process, use a standard `SendMessage` call to pass the WM_GETCONTROLNAME message. WM_GETCONTROLNAME is independent of the language and Windows hierarchy. For more information, see the \\\"Recommended Solution for Windows Forms\\\" topic in[Automating Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms996405.aspx).  \\n  \\n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.InvokeRequired%2A> property to synchronize access to the control from multiple threads. For more information about multithreaded Windows Forms controls, see [How to: Make Thread-Safe Calls to Windows Forms Controls](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.DefaultEvent(\"Click\")]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.DefaultProperty(\"Text\")]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.DesignerSerializer(\"System.Windows.Forms.Design.ControlCodeDomSerializer, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\", \"System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomSerializer, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\")]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.Designer(\"System.Windows.Forms.Design.ControlDesigner, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\")]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItemFilter(\"System.Windows.Forms\")]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterface(System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceType.AutoDispatch)]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public class Control : System.ComponentModel.Component, IDisposable, System.ComponentModel.ISynchronizeInvoke, System.Windows.Forms.IBindableComponent, System.Windows.Forms.IDropTarget, System.Windows.Forms.IWin32Window\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component\n  implements:\n  - System.ComponentModel.ISynchronizeInvoke\n  - System.IDisposable\n  - System.Windows.Forms.IBindableComponent\n  - System.Windows.Forms.IDropTarget\n  - System.Windows.Forms.IWin32Window\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Container\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.DesignMode\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Dispose\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Disposed\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Events\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.GetService(System.Type)\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.ToString\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.CreateObjRef(System.Type)\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.GetLifetimeService\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.InitializeLifetimeService\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.MemberwiseClone(System.Boolean)\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.Control.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.Control\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Control()\n  nameWithType: Control.Control()\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.Control.Control()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Windows.Forms.Control\"></xref> class with default settings.\n  remarks: The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class is the base class for all controls used in a Windows Forms application.

The `ChartControlAccessibleObject` class, which derives from `ControlAccessibleObject`, is used in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateAccessibilityInstance%2A> method to provide custom accessible information for the chart control. Since the chart legend is not an actual <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> -based control, but instead is drawn by the chart control, it does not any built-in accessible information.

Therefore, if you are calling a control's method from a different thread, you must use one of the control's invoke methods to marshal the call to the proper thread. This property can be used to determine if you must call an invoke method, which can be useful if you do not know what thread owns a control.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In addition to the InvokeRequired property, there are four methods on a control that are thread safe to call: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A>,<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.EndInvoke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A> if the handle for the control has already been created. Calling <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A> before the control's handle has been created on a background thread can cause illegal cross thread calls. For all other method calls, you should use one of these invoke methods when calling from a different thread.  \\n  \\n If the control's handle does not yet exist, InvokeRequired searches up the control's parent chain until it finds a control or form that does have a window handle. If no appropriate handle can be found, the InvokeRequired method returns `false`.  \\n  \\n This means that InvokeRequiredcan return `false` if <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A> is not required (the call occurs on the same thread), or if the control was created on a different thread but the control's handle has not yet been created.  \\n  \\n In the case where the control's handle has not yet been created, you should not simply call properties, methods, or events on the control. This might cause the control's handle to be created on the background thread, isolating the control on a thread without a message pump and making the application unstable.  \\n  \\n You can protect against this case by also checking the value of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsHandleCreated%2A> when InvokeRequired returns `false` on a background thread. If the control handle has not yet been created, you must wait until it has been created before calling <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A>. Typically, this happens only if a background thread is created in the constructor of the primary form for the application (as in `Application.Run(new MainForm())`, before the form has been shown or `Application.Run` has been called.  \\n  \\n One solution is to wait until the form's handle has been created before starting the background thread. Either force handle creation by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Handle%2A> property, or wait until the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event to start the background process.  \\n  \\n An even better solution is to use the `SynchronizationContext` returned by <xref:System.Threading.SynchronizationContext> rather than a control for cross-thread marshaling.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  An exception might be thrown if the thread that should process the message is no longer active.  \\n  \\n For more information about multithreaded Windows Forms controls, see [How to: Use a Background Thread to Search for Files](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) and [How to: Make Thread-Safe Calls to Windows Forms Controls](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public bool InvokeRequired { get; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_true\" name=\"true\" href=\"\"></xref> if the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Handle*> was created on a different thread than the calling thread (indicating that you must make calls to the control through an invoke method); otherwise, <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_false\" name=\"false\" href=\"\"></xref>.\n  overload: System.Windows.Forms.Control.InvokeRequired*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsAccessible\n  id: IsAccessible\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.Control\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsAccessible\n  nameWithType: Control.IsAccessible\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsAccessible\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Gets or sets a value indicating whether the control is visible to accessibility applications.\n  syntax:\n    content: public bool IsAccessible { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_true\" name=\"true\" href=\"\"></xref> if the control is visible to accessibility applications; otherwise, <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_false\" name=\"false\" href=\"\"></xref>.\n  overload: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsAccessible*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsDisposed\n  id: IsDisposed\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.Control\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsDisposed\n  nameWithType: Control.IsDisposed\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsDisposed\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Gets a value indicating whether the control has been disposed of.\n  remarks: When this property returns `true`, the control is disposed of and can no longer be referenced as a valid Windows control.

In this case, the keypress never reaches the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnKeyDown%2A> method override. To prevent this default behavior, the IsInputKey method override returns `true` when the user presses the TAB key. For all other keypresses, the IsInputKey method override returns the result of calling the base-class version of the method.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputKey#0](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.windows.forms.c_106_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputKey#0](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.windows.forms.c_106_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: protected virtual bool IsInputKey (System.Windows.Forms.Keys keyData);\n    parameters:\n    - id: keyData\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.Keys\n      description: One of the <xref href=\"System.Windows.Forms.Keys\"></xref> values.\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_true\" name=\"true\" href=\"\"></xref> if the specified key is a regular input key; otherwise, <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_false\" name=\"false\" href=\"\"></xref>.\n  overload: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputKey*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsKeyLocked(System.Windows.Forms.Keys)\n  id: IsKeyLocked(System.Windows.Forms.Keys)\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.Control\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsKeyLocked(Keys)\n  nameWithType: Control.IsKeyLocked(Keys)\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsKeyLocked(Keys)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Determines whether the CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, or SCROLL LOCK key is in effect.\n  remarks: Use the IsKeyLocked property to determine whether the CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, or SCROLL LOCK keys are on, whether individually or in combination.\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example displays a message box indicating whether the specified key (the Caps Lock key in this case) is in effect.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[ControlIsKeyLocked#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.windows.forms.c_2_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cpp[ControlIsKeyLocked#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/m-system.windows.forms.c_2_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-cs[ControlIsKeyLocked#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.windows.forms.c_2_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public static bool IsKeyLocked (System.Windows.Forms.Keys keyVal);\n    parameters:\n    - id: keyVal\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.Keys\n      description: The CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, or SCROLL LOCK member of the <xref href=\"System.Windows.Forms.Keys\"></xref> enumeration.\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_true\" name=\"true\" href=\"\"></xref> if the specified key or keys are in effect; otherwise, <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_false\" name=\"false\" href=\"\"></xref>.\n  overload: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsKeyLocked*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.NotSupportedException\n    commentId: T:System.NotSupportedException\n    description: The <code>keyVal</code> parameter refers to a key other than the CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, or SCROLL LOCK key.\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsMirrored\n  id: IsMirrored\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.Control\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsMirrored\n  nameWithType: Control.IsMirrored\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsMirrored\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Gets a value indicating whether the control is mirrored.\n  remarks: 'A mirrored control displays both layout and text from right to left.
