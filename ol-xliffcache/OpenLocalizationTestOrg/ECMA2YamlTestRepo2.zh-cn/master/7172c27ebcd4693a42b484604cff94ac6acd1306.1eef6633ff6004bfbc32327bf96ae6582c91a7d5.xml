A Window is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>, which means that it can contain a single object of any type (such as a string, an image, or a panel). For more information, see the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl> class.

For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the Window, see [Window Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.

This icon is used as the desktop icon for an assembly.          > [!NOTE]     >  When debugging in Visual Studio, your icon may not appear due to the hosting process. If you run the executable, the icon will appear. For more information, see [Hosting Process (vshost.exe)](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).      -   One icon per window that is specified by setting Icon. For each window, this icon is used in its title bar, its task bar button, and in its ALT-TAB application selection list entry.       A [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] window always displays an icon. When one is not provided by setting Icon, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] chooses an icon to display based on the following rules:      1.  Use the assembly icon, if specified.      2.  If the assembly icon is not specified, use the default [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] icon.       If you use Icon to specify a custom window icon, you can restore the default application icon by setting Icon to `null`.       A single icon can be used in a variety of ways in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], including being shown in the title bar of a window, the task bar for a window, the ALT+TAB file selection list. Each of these shows the icon using a different size; a 16x16 pixel icon is displayed in the title bar of a window and in the task bar, while a 32x32 pixel icon is displayed in the ALT+TAB file selection list. Some applications, like [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winexpl](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-winexpl-md.md)], provide a **View** menu that allows you to choose the size of the icon you'd like to view.       To cater to the various display sizes, an icon file is composed of one or more actual icons where each one represents a version of the icon that targets a specific size and color depth. For example, one icon may only have a single 16x16 pixel icon with 16 colors, while another may contain 16x16 pixel and 32x32 pixel icons with both 16 colors and 256 colors.       If icons for all possible sizes and color depths exist within an icon file, <xref:System.Windows.Window> will use the appropriate icon. If an icon file contains only a subset of all the possible icons, <xref:System.Windows.Window> uses the next most appropriate icon in order of decreasing sizes and color depth.       The result is that an icon will always be used by <xref:System.Windows.Window>, although the icon used may not target the required size and color depth.

This list is exposed by the <xref:System.Windows.Application.Windows%2A> property.  \\n  \\n-   By default, <xref:System.Windows.Application.MainWindow%2A> is automatically set with a reference to the first Window that is instantiated in an application. This thereby making the window the main application window.  \\n  \\n A Window can be implemented using markup, markup and code-behind, or code.  \\n  \\n Window is primarily used to display windows and dialog boxes for standalone applications. However, for applications that require navigation at the window level, such as wizards, you can use <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> instead; <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> derives from Window and extends it with browser-style navigation support.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Islands of navigable content can be incorporated into other content and content containers using <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>.  \\n  \\n Window needs `UnmanagedCode` security permission to be instantiated. This has the following consequences:  \\n  \\n-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clickonce](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-clickonce-md.md)]-deployed standalone applications will request permission elevation when launched from either the Internet or Local Intranet zones.  \\n  \\n-   [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] that request anything less than full permissions will not be able to instantiate windows or dialog boxes.  \\n  \\n For information about standalone application deployment and security considerations, see [WPF Security Strategy - Platform Security](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n A Window is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>, which means that it can contain a single object of any type (such as a string, an image, or a panel). For more information, see the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl> class. Also, Window is a root element and, therefore, cannot be part of another element's content.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Window.Top%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Window.Left%2A> properties set on a Window through a style will not be applied at run time.  \\n  \\n## Customizing the Window Control  \\n To apply the same property settings to multiple Window controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the Window, see [Window Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in Window control's default template and is set by using a .

For each window, this icon is used in its title bar, its task bar button, and in its ALT-TAB application selection list entry.  \\n  \\n A [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] window always displays an icon. When one is not provided by setting Icon, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] chooses an icon to display based on the following rules:  \\n  \\n1.  Use the assembly icon, if specified.  \\n  \\n2.  If the assembly icon is not specified, use the default [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] icon.  \\n  \\n If you use Icon to specify a custom window icon, you can restore the default application icon by setting Icon to `null`.  \\n  \\n A single icon can be used in a variety of ways in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], including being shown in the title bar of a window, the task bar for a window, the ALT+TAB file selection list. Each of these shows the icon using a different size; a 16x16 pixel icon is displayed in the title bar of a window and in the task bar, while a 32x32 pixel icon is displayed in the ALT+TAB file selection list. Some applications, like [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winexpl](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-winexpl-md.md)], provide a **View** menu that allows you to choose the size of the icon you'd like to view.  \\n  \\n To cater to the various display sizes, an icon file is composed of one or more actual icons where each one represents a version of the icon that targets a specific size and color depth. For example, one icon may only have a single 16x16 pixel icon with 16 colors, while another may contain 16x16 pixel and 32x32 pixel icons with both 16 colors and 256 colors.  \\n  \\n If icons for all possible sizes and color depths exist within an icon file, <xref:System.Windows.Window> will use the appropriate icon. If an icon file contains only a subset of all the possible icons, <xref:System.Windows.Window> uses the next most appropriate icon in order of decreasing sizes and color depth.  \\n  \\n The result is that an icon will always be used by <xref:System.Windows.Window>, although the icon used may not target the required size and color depth. For example, a 16x16 pixel icon with 16 colors may be used for display as a 32x32 pixel icon with 256 colors. This can cause undesirable visual effects, such as pixilation, but may be avoided by creating icons for all targeted sizes and color depths.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You cannot set or get this property when a window is hosted in a browser.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"dependencyPropertyInfo_WindowIcon\\\"></a>   \\n## Dependency Property Information  \\n  \\n|||  \\n|-|-|  \\n|Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.Window.IconProperty>|  \\n|Metadata properties set to `true`|None|\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example shows how to set a window icon.  \\n  \\n [!code-xml[WindowIconSnippets#WindowIconSetXAML](~/add/codesnippet/xaml/WindowIconSnippets.WindowIconSample/MainWindow.xaml#windowiconsetxaml)]  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WindowIconSnippets#SetWindowIconInCode](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/windowiconsample/mainwindow.xaml.vb#setwindowiconincode)]\\n [!code-cs[WindowIconSnippets#SetWindowIconInCode](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/WindowIconSnippets.WindowIconSample/MainWindow.xaml.cs#setwindowiconincode)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.Windows.Media.ImageSource Icon { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Media.ImageSource\n      description: An <xref href=\"System.Windows.Media.ImageSource\"></xref> object that represents the icon.\n  overload: System.Windows.Window.Icon*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Window.IconProperty\n  id: IconProperty\n  parent: System.Windows.Window\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IconProperty\n  nameWithType: Window.IconProperty\n  fullName: System.Windows.Window.IconProperty\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Identifies the <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon*> dependency property.\n  syntax:\n    content: public static readonly System.Windows.DependencyProperty IconProperty;\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.DependencyProperty\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Window.IsActive\n  id: IsActive\n  parent: System.Windows.Window\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsActive\n  nameWithType: Window.IsActive\n  fullName: System.Windows.Window.IsActive\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Gets a value that indicates whether the window is active.\n  remarks: \"An active window is the user's current foreground window and has the focus, which is signified by the active appearance of the title bar.
