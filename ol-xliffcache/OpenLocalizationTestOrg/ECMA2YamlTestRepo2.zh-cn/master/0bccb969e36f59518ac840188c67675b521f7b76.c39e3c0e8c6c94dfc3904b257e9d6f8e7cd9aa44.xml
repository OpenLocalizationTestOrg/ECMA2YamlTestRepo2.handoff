This class provides formatting capabilities that ASP.NET server controls use when rendering markup to clients.\n  remarks: \"The HtmlTextWriter class is used to render HTML 4.0 to desktop browsers. The HtmlTextWriter is also the base class for all markup writers in the <xref:System.Web.UI> namespace, including the <xref:System.Web.UI.ChtmlTextWriter>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Html32TextWriter>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.XhtmlTextWriter> classes. These classes are used to write the elements, attributes, and style and layout information for different types of markup. In addition, these classes are used by the page and control adapter classes that are associated with each markup language.  \\n  \\n In most circumstances, ASP.NET automatically uses the appropriate writer for the requesting device. However, if you create a custom text writer or if you want to specify a particular writer to render a page for a specific device, you must map the writer to the page in the `controlAdapters` section of the application .browser file.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how to override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Render%2A> method of a custom control that is derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class.
