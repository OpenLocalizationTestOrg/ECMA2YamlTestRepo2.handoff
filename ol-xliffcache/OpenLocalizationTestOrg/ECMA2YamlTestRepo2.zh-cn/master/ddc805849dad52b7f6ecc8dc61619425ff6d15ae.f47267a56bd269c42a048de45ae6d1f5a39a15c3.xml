If the state of the AppDomain that's executing a task becomes unstable, the AppDomain can be unloaded without affecting the process. This is important when a process must run for long periods without restarting. You can also use application domains to isolate tasks that should not share data.      -   If an assembly is loaded into the default application domain, it cannot be unloaded from memory while the process is running. However, if you open a second application domain to load and execute the assembly, the assembly is unloaded when that application domain is unloaded. Use this technique to minimize the working set of long-running processes that occasionally use large DLLs.       Multiple application domains can run in a single process; however, there is not a one-to-one correlation between application domains and threads. Several threads can belong to a single application domain, and while a given thread is not confined to a single application domain, at any given time, a thread executes in a single application domain.       Application domains are created using the <xref:System.AppDomain.CreateDomain%2A> method. AppDomain instances are used to load and execute assemblies (<xref:System.Reflection.Assembly>). When an AppDomain is no longer in use, it can be unloaded.       The AppDomain class implements a set of events that enable applications to respond when an assembly is loaded, when an application domain will be unloaded, or when an unhandled exception is thrown.

This event can be handled in any application domain. However, the event is not necessarily raised in the application domain where the exception occurred. An exception is unhandled only if the entire stack for the thread has been unwound without finding an applicable exception handler, so the first place the event can be raised is in the application domain where the thread originated.      > [!NOTE] >  In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, this event occurs only for the default application domain that is created by the system when an application is started. If an application creates additional application domains, specifying a delegate for this event in those applications domains has no effect.       If the UnhandledException event is handled in the default application domain, it is raised there for any unhandled exception in any thread, no matter what application domain the thread started in. If the thread started in an application domain that has an event handler for UnhandledException, the event is raised in that application domain. If that application domain is not the default application domain, and there is also an event handler in the default application domain, the event is raised in both application domains.       For example, suppose a thread starts in application domain \"AD1\", calls a method in application domain \"AD2\", and from there calls a method in application domain \"AD3\", where it throws an exception. The first application domain in which the UnhandledException event can be raised is \"AD1\". If that application domain is not the default application domain, the event can also be raised in the default application domain.      > [!NOTE] >  The common language runtime suspends thread aborts while event handlers for the UnhandledException event are executing.       If the event handler has a <xref:System.Runtime.ConstrainedExecution.ReliabilityContractAttribute> attribute with the appropriate flags, the event handler is treated as a constrained execution region.       Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/add/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], this event is not raised for exceptions that corrupt the state of the process, such as stack overflows or access violations, unless the event handler is security-critical and has the <xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute.       In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, an unhandled exception that occurs in a thread other than the main application thread is caught by the runtime and therefore does not cause the application to terminate. Thus, it is possible for the UnhandledException event to be raised without the application terminating. Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, this backstop for unhandled exceptions in child threads was removed, because the cumulative effect of such silent failures included performance degradation, corrupted data, and lockups, all of which were difficult to debug. For more information, including a list of cases in which the runtime does not terminate, see [Exceptions in Managed Threads](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       To register an event handler for this event, you must have the required permissions, or a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown.       For more information about handling events, see [Events](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).      ## Other Events for Unhandled Exceptions    For certain application models, the UnhandledException event can be preempted by other events if the unhandled exception occurs in the main application thread.       In applications that use Windows Forms, unhandled exceptions in the main application thread cause the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.ThreadException?displayProperty=fullName> event to be raised. If this event is handled, the default behavior is that the unhandled exception does not terminate the application, although the application is left in an unknown state. In that case, the UnhandledException event is not raised. This behavior can be changed by using the application configuration file, or by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.SetUnhandledExceptionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to change the mode to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UnhandledExceptionMode?displayProperty=fullName> before the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.ThreadException> event handler is hooked up. This applies only to the main application thread. The UnhandledException event is raised for unhandled exceptions thrown in other threads.       Starting with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, the Visual Basic application framework provides another event for unhandled exceptions in the main application thread. See the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase.UnhandledException?displayProperty=fullName> event. This event has an event arguments object with the same name as the event arguments object used by UnhandledException, but with different properties. In particular, this event arguments object has an <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.UnhandledExceptionEventArgs.ExitApplication%2A> property that allows the application to continue running, ignoring the unhandled exception (and leaving the application in an unknown state). In that case, the UnhandledException event is not raised.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This event provides notification of uncaught exceptions.","pos":[0,56]},{"content":"It allows the application to log information about the exception before the system default handler reports the exception to the user and terminates the application.","pos":[57,221]},{"content":"If sufficient information about the state of the application is available, other actions may be undertaken — such as saving program data for later recovery.","pos":[222,378]},{"content":"Caution is advised, because program data can become corrupted when exceptions are not handled.","pos":[379,473]},{"content":"&gt;

This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"Application domains, which are represented by AppDomain objects, help provide isolation, unloading, and security boundaries for executing managed code.  \\n  \\n-   Use application domains to isolate tasks that might bring down a process. If the state of the AppDomain that's executing a task becomes unstable, the AppDomain can be unloaded without affecting the process. This is important when a process must run for long periods without restarting. You can also use application domains to isolate tasks that should not share data.  \\n  \\n-   If an assembly is loaded into the default application domain, it cannot be unloaded from memory while the process is running. However, if you open a second application domain to load and execute the assembly, the assembly is unloaded when that application domain is unloaded. Use this technique to minimize the working set of long-running processes that occasionally use large DLLs.  \\n  \\n Multiple application domains can run in a single process; however, there is not a one-to-one correlation between application domains and threads. Several threads can belong to a single application domain, and while a given thread is not confined to a single application domain, at any given time, a thread executes in a single application domain.  \\n  \\n Application domains are created using the <xref:System.AppDomain.CreateDomain%2A> method. AppDomain instances are used to load and execute assemblies (<xref:System.Reflection.Assembly>). When an AppDomain is no longer in use, it can be unloaded.  \\n  \\n The AppDomain class implements a set of events that enable applications to respond when an assembly is loaded, when an application domain will be unloaded, or when an unhandled exception is thrown.  \\n  \\n For more information on using application domains, see [Application Domains](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n This class implements the <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>, <xref:System._AppDomain>, and <xref:System.Security.IEvidenceFactory> interfaces.  \\n  \\n You should never create a remotable wrapper for an AppDomain object. Doing so could publish a remote reference to that AppDomain, exposing methods such as <xref:System.AppDomain.CreateInstance%2A> to remote access and effectively destroying code access security for that AppDomain. Malicious clients connecting to the remoted AppDomain could obtain access to any resource the AppDomain itself has access to. Do not create remotable wrappers for any type that extends <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject> and that implements methods that could be used by malicious clients to bypass the security system.  \\n  \\n> [!CAUTION]\\n>  The default value for the <xref:System.AppDomainSetup.DisallowCodeDownload%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is `false`. This setting is unsafe for services. To prevent services from downloading partially trusted code, set this property to `true`.\"\n  example:\n  - \"This example shows how to create a new AppDomain, instantiate a type in that new AppDomain, and communicate with that type’s object.

The example builds a path to the currently executing assembly, creates a target application domain, and uses the CreateInstanceFrom method overload to load the example assembly into the target application domain and create an instance of `MarshallableExample`.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The path is absolute in this example, but a relative path would also work because the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFrom%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is used to load the assembly.  \\n  \\n After unwrapping the object handle, the example demonstrates three ways to use an object in a target application domain:  \\n  \\n-   Invoking a method with late binding, using reflection. This requires type information, which causes the assembly to be loaded into the application domain of the caller. (In this example, it is already loaded.)  \\n  \\n-   Casting the object to an interface known to both the caller and the callee. If the interface is defined in the calling assembly or in a third assembly referenced by both the caller and the callee, the called assembly is not loaded into the application domain of the caller.  \\n  \\n-   Using the object directly when its type is known to the caller. The assembly must be loaded into the application domain of the caller.  \\n  \\n Another way to avoid loading the called assembly into the application domain of the caller is for the caller to derive from the <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject> class and to define a method that can be run in the target application domain. That method can use reflection to examine a target assembly, because the target assembly is already loaded into the target application domain.

Be sure to compile the example in a different location. Delete the base directory and all its subdirectories each time you run the example.  \\n  \\n The example creates a new application domain, using the <xref:System.AppDomainSetup> object.

(The example could just as easily create the directory beforehand by concatenating the original path, the hash code of the application name, and the application name.)  \\n  \\n The example has a `GenerateDynamicAssembly` method that emits an assembly named `DynamicHelloWorld.dll` and stores it in the new application domain's dynamic directory. The dynamic assembly contains one type, `HelloWorld`, that has a static method (`Shared` method in Visual Basic) named `HelloFromAD`. Calling this method displays the name of the application domain.  \\n  \\n The `Example` class derives from <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>, so the example can create an instance of the class in the new application domain and call its `Test` method. The `Test` method loads the dynamic assembly by its display name and calls the static `HelloFromAD` method.  \\n  \\n You can show that the dynamic directory is searched after the normal probing paths by writing code for an assembly named `DynamicHelloWorld.dll` and compiling it in the same directory as this example. The assembly must have a class named `HelloWorld` with a static method named `HelloFromAD`. This method does not have to have the same functionality as the one in the example; it can simply display a string to the console. The assembly must also have an <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyVersionAttribute> attribute that sets its version to 1.0.0.0.

Handling this event does not handle the exception or affect subsequent exception handling in any way. After the event has been raised and event handlers have been invoked, the common language runtime (CLR) begins to search for a handler for the exception. FirstChanceException provides the application domain with a first chance to examine any managed exception.  \\n  \\n The event can be handled per application domain. If a thread passes through multiple application domains while executing a call, the event is raised in each application domain that has registered an event handler, before the CLR begins searching for a matching exception handler in that application domain. After the event has been handled, a search is made for a matching exception handler in that application domain. If none is found, the event is raised in the next application domain.  \\n  \\n You must handle all exceptions that occur in the event handler for the FirstChanceException event. Otherwise, FirstChanceException is raised recursively. This could result in a stack overflow and termination of the application. We recommend that you implement event handlers for this event as constrained execution regions (CERs), to keep infrastructure-related exceptions such as out-of-memory or stack overflow from affecting the virtual machine while the exception notification is being processed.  \\n  \\n This event is not raised for exceptions that indicate corruption of process state, such as access violations, unless the event handler is security-critical and has the <xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute.  \\n  \\n The common language runtime suspends thread aborts while this notification event is being handled.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example creates a series of application domains named `AD0` through `AD3`, with a `Worker` object in each application domain. Each `Worker` object has a reference to the `Worker` object in the next application domain, except for the `Worker` in the last application domain. The FirstChanceException event is handled in all application domains except `AD1`.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In addition to this example, which demonstrates first-chance exception notifications in multiple application domains, you can find simple use cases in [How to: Receive First-Chance Exception Notifications](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n When the application domains have been created, the default application domain calls the `TestException` method for the first application domain. Each `Worker` object calls the `TestException` method for the next application domain, until the last `Worker` throws an exception that is either handled or unhandled. Thus, the current thread passes through all the application domains, and `TestException` is added to the stack in each application domain.  \\n  \\n When the last `Worker` object handles the exception, the FirstChanceException event is raised only in the last application domain. The other application domains never get a chance to handle the exception, so the event is not raised.  \\n  \\n When the last `Worker` object does not handle the exception, the FirstChanceException event is raised in each application domain that has an event handler. After each event handler has finished, the stack continues to unwind until the exception is caught by the default application domain.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To see how the stack display grows as the event is raised closer and closer to the default application domain, change `e.Exception.Message` to `e.Exception` in the `FirstChanceHandler` event handlers. Notice that when `TestException` is called across application domain boundaries, it appears twice: once for the proxy and once for the stub.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[System.AppDomain.FirstChanceException#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/e-system.appdomain.first_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[System.AppDomain.FirstChanceException#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/e-system.appdomain.first_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public event EventHandler<System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.FirstChanceExceptionEventArgs> FirstChanceException;\n    return:\n      type: System.EventHandler{System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.FirstChanceExceptionEventArgs}\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.AppDomain.FriendlyName\n  id: FriendlyName\n  parent: System.AppDomain\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: FriendlyName\n  nameWithType: AppDomain.FriendlyName\n  fullName: System.AppDomain.FriendlyName\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - mscorlib\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Gets the friendly name of this application domain.\n  remarks: The friendly name of the default application domain is the file name of the process executable.

It allows the application to log information about the exception before the system default handler reports the exception to the user and terminates the application.

Caution is advised, because program data can become corrupted when exceptions are not handled.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, application termination and debugging options are reported to the user before this event is raised, rather than after.  \\n  \\n This event can be handled in any application domain. However, the event is not necessarily raised in the application domain where the exception occurred. An exception is unhandled only if the entire stack for the thread has been unwound without finding an applicable exception handler, so the first place the event can be raised is in the application domain where the thread originated.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, this event occurs only for the default application domain that is created by the system when an application is started. If an application creates additional application domains, specifying a delegate for this event in those applications domains has no effect.  \\n  \\n If the UnhandledException event is handled in the default application domain, it is raised there for any unhandled exception in any thread, no matter what application domain the thread started in. If the thread started in an application domain that has an event handler for UnhandledException, the event is raised in that application domain. If that application domain is not the default application domain, and there is also an event handler in the default application domain, the event is raised in both application domains.  \\n  \\n For example, suppose a thread starts in application domain \\\"AD1\\\", calls a method in application domain \\\"AD2\\\", and from there calls a method in application domain \\\"AD3\\\", where it throws an exception. The first application domain in which the UnhandledException event can be raised is \\\"AD1\\\". If that application domain is not the default application domain, the event can also be raised in the default application domain.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The common language runtime suspends thread aborts while event handlers for the UnhandledException event are executing.  \\n  \\n If the event handler has a <xref:System.Runtime.ConstrainedExecution.ReliabilityContractAttribute> attribute with the appropriate flags, the event handler is treated as a constrained execution region.  \\n  \\n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/add/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], this event is not raised for exceptions that corrupt the state of the process, such as stack overflows or access violations, unless the event handler is security-critical and has the <xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute.  \\n  \\n In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, an unhandled exception that occurs in a thread other than the main application thread is caught by the runtime and therefore does not cause the application to terminate. Thus, it is possible for the UnhandledException event to be raised without the application terminating. Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, this backstop for unhandled exceptions in child threads was removed, because the cumulative effect of such silent failures included performance degradation, corrupted data, and lockups, all of which were difficult to debug. For more information, including a list of cases in which the runtime does not terminate, see [Exceptions in Managed Threads](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n To register an event handler for this event, you must have the required permissions, or a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown.  \\n  \\n For more information about handling events, see [Events](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n## Other Events for Unhandled Exceptions  \\n For certain application models, the UnhandledException event can be preempted by other events if the unhandled exception occurs in the main application thread.  \\n  \\n In applications that use Windows Forms, unhandled exceptions in the main application thread cause the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.ThreadException?displayProperty=fullName> event to be raised. If this event is handled, the default behavior is that the unhandled exception does not terminate the application, although the application is left in an unknown state. In that case, the UnhandledException event is not raised. This behavior can be changed by using the application configuration file, or by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.SetUnhandledExceptionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to change the mode to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UnhandledExceptionMode?displayProperty=fullName> before the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.ThreadException> event handler is hooked up. This applies only to the main application thread. The UnhandledException event is raised for unhandled exceptions thrown in other threads.  \\n  \\n Starting with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, the Visual Basic application framework provides another event for unhandled exceptions in the main application thread. See the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase.UnhandledException?displayProperty=fullName> event. This event has an event arguments object with the same name as the event arguments object used by UnhandledException, but with different properties. In particular, this event arguments object has an <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.UnhandledExceptionEventArgs.ExitApplication%2A> property that allows the application to continue running, ignoring the unhandled exception (and leaving the application in an unknown state). In that case, the UnhandledException event is not raised.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The followingexample demonstrates the UnhandledException event. It defines an event handler, `MyHandler`, that is invoked whenever an unhandled exception is thrown in the default application domain. It then throws two exceptions. The first is handled by a **try/catch** block.

This improves reliability, especially when the .NET Framework is hosted. When a thread calls Unload, the target domain is marked for unloading. The dedicated thread attempts to unload the domain, and all threads in the domain are aborted. If a thread does not abort, for example because it is executing unmanaged code, or because it is executing a `finally` block, then after a period of time a <xref:System.CannotUnloadAppDomainException> is thrown in the thread that originally called Unload. If the thread that could not be aborted eventually ends, the target domain is not unloaded. Thus, in the .NET Framework version 2.0 `domain` is not guaranteed to unload, because it might not be possible to terminate executing threads.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In some cases, calling Unload causes an immediate <xref:System.CannotUnloadAppDomainException>, for example if it is called in a finalizer.  \\n  \\n The threads in `domain` are terminated using the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method, which throws a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> in the thread. Although the thread should terminate promptly, it can continue executing for an unpredictable amount of time in a `finally` clause.  \\n  \\n## Version Compatibility  \\n In the .NET Framework version 1.0 and 1.1 if the thread that calls Unload is running in `domain`, another thread is started to perform the unload operation.
