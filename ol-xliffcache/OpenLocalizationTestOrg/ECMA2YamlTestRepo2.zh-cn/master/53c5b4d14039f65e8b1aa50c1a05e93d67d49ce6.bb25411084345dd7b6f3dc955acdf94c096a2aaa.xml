When this  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] is applied to the get accessor for an attached property, this  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] specifies that an attached property is browsable when the attached property owner is a parent element of other elements.       When interpreted by a designer that uses type descriptor information, the designer should add this property as a browsable property to all child elements in the logical tree, based on the parent element with this  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] applied.       Generally, the browsable state parallels functionality. For example, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Left%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is designated browsable on elements that are child elements of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>, because <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> includes code for checking any set values of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Left%2A?displayProperty=fullName> on child elements.       This  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] supports two types of tree detection modes for parent element positions:  a shallow mode, and a deep mode. The shallow mode, which is the default mode for an applied AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)], requires that the immediate parent element be the owner type of the property in order for the attached property to be browsable. The deep mode is declared by applying the attribute with <xref:System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.IncludeDescendants%2A> as `true`. The deep mode is less restrictive because it only requires that the owner type be somewhere in the ancestor direction of the logical tree., and therefore the attached property is browsable on all child elements, not just immediate child elements. The deep mode is applied for attached property usages where intervening elements in the logical tree should not be reported as the true parent element. Implicit collections (for example, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UIElementCollection> that is implicit in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>) are not considered to be parent elements for purposes of how this  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] declares the tree detection mode.       This [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] should only be applied on the get accessor of attached property definitions. Do not apply this [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] to the set accessor. Although intuitively it is the set operation that is being made browsable for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] on child elements, it is the presence and characteristics of the get accessor on the parent element that controls the true behavior.       Whether an attached property is browsable on a child element is not an absolute guarantee that the attached property value is really processed by the parent element in some manner. Also, the <xref:System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.IncludeDescendants%2A> value is not an absolute guarantee that the processing scope does or does not extend beyond the immediate parent element. All this is implementation specific. However, this  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] for reporting the browsable state is the best available mechanism for reporting the usage information and functional information for an attached property. Therefore, you can generally assume that the browsable state of an attached property is analogous to the behavior of how an attached property value on a child element is processed or interpreted by the relevant parent element in your application code.

Do not apply this [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] to the set accessor. Although intuitively it is the set operation that is being made browsable for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] on child elements, it is the presence and characteristics of the get accessor on the parent element that controls the true behavior.  \\n  \\n Whether an attached property is browsable on a child element is not an absolute guarantee that the attached property value is really processed by the parent element in some manner. Also, the <xref:System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.IncludeDescendants%2A> value is not an absolute guarantee that the processing scope does or does not extend beyond the immediate parent element. All this is implementation specific. However, this  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] for reporting the browsable state is the best available mechanism for reporting the usage information and functional information for an attached property. Therefore, you can generally assume that the browsable state of an attached property is analogous to the behavior of how an attached property value on a child element is processed or interpreted by the relevant parent element in your application code.  \\n  \\n For general information on declaring attached properties, see [Attached Properties Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xamlTextUsage_AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\\\"></a>   \\n## XAML Text Usage  \\n Members of this type are not typically used in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)].\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.AttributeUsage(System.AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple=false)]\n\n      public sealed class AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute : System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableAttribute\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Attribute\n  - System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableAttribute\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute()\n  nameWithType: AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute()\n  fullName: System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: The default for <xref:System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.IncludeDescendants%2A> is `false`.\n  syntax:\n    content: public AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute ();\n    parameters: []\n  overload: System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.#ctor*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.Equals(System.Object)\n  id: Equals(System.Object)\n  parent: System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Equals(Object)\n  nameWithType: AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.Equals(Object)\n  fullName: System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.Equals(Object)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Determines whether the current <xref href=\"System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\"></xref> [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)] is equal to a specified object.\n  remarks: This implementation supports value equality of the one possible settable value exposed by this [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_netframewkattr](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-netframewkattr-md.md)], <xref:System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute.IncludeDescendants%2A>.\n  syntax:\n    content: public override bool Equals (object obj);\n    parameters:\n    - id: obj\n      type: System.Object\n      description: The <xref href=\"System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\"></xref> to compare to the current <xref href=\"System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\"></xref>.\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_true\" name=\"true\" href=\"\"></xref> if the specified <xref href=\"System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\"></xref> is equal to the current <xref href=\"System.Windows.AttachedPropertyBrowsableForChildrenAttribute\"></xref>;
