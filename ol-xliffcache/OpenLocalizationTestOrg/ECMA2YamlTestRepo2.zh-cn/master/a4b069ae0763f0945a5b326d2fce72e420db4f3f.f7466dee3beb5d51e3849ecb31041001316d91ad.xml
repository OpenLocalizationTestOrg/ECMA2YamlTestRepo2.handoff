Derived implementations should follow the logic described below.       The set of returned items is constrained by the `pageIndex` and `pageSize` parameters, where `pageSize` sets the number of records to return and `pageIndex` sets which records to return. For example, a `pageIndex` of 0 and a `pageSize` of 25 would return the first 25 occurrences, while a `pageIndex` of 1 and a `pageSize` of 25 would return occurrences 26-50. If you want to retrieve all available records, set `pageIndex` to 0 and `pageSize` to <xref:System.Int32.MaxValue>.

This method passes query wildcard characters to the underlying data store. Support for wildcard characters is currently dependent on how each provider handles characters such as an asterisk (*), a percent symbol (%), or an underscore (_).

For example, to find all paths that start with \"~/vdir\", the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.PathToMatch%2A> property would be set to \"~/vdir%\".       Likewise, a wildcard search on a partial user name could have the wildcard character appear at any point in the text string of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.UsernameToMatch%2A> property.
