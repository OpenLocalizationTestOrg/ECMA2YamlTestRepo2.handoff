Every application, every operating system, and every run-time library contains code dedicated to converting an internal binary format numeric value to a string of characters, and vice versa. These conversion routines are coded to use Unicode digits \\\"0030\\\" through \\\"0039\\\".  \\n  \\n The NumberSubstitution class provides functionality that allows different cultures to substitute the appropriate digit shapes at rendering time. This functionality is similar to the one used for providing font substitution and language dependent font rendering.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Many cultures are discarding their traditional digits shapes and adopting Western digits shapes, therefore the number substitution functionality recognizes the distinction for each culture between traditional digit shapes and national standard digit shapes.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xamlTextUsage_NumberSubstitution\\\"></a>   \\n## XAML Text Usage  \\n This type is not typically used in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] as an object element.

In this usage, the property is not backed by a dependency property identifier, it is backed by a private field and does not act as a dependency property.  \\n  \\n-   You can set this property as an attached property usage in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]. The attached property usage is the reason why this property has a Dependency Property Information section, because the attached property is backed by a dependency property identifier. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], the usage is `<`*object* **NumberSubstitution.Substitution**`=\\\"`*value*`\\\".../>`, where *object* is an object element where the specified number substitution logic applies, and *value* is a string representation of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.NumberSubstitutionMethod> value. In code, the attached property usage is supported by <xref:System.Windows.Media.NumberSubstitution.GetSubstitution%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.NumberSubstitution.SetSubstitution%2A>.  \\n
