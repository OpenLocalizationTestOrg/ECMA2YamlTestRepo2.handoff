For instance, a Web Forms client can persist the HTTP cookie by saving the <xref:System.Net.CookieContainer> in its own session state.

The most common use of the MessageName property will be to uniquely identify polymorphic methods. By default, MessageName is set to the name of the XML Web service method.

If an XML Web service method with a TransactionOption property of `Required` or `RequiresNew` invokes another XML Web service method with a TransactionOption property of `Required` or `RequiresNew`, each XML Web service method participates in its own transaction, because an XML Web service method can only act as the root object in a transaction.  \\n  \\n|Item|Description|  \\n|----------|-----------------|  \\n|Disabled|Indicates that the XML Web service method does not run within the scope of a transaction.
