The second one, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.%23ctor%28System.Collections.ICollection%29>, initializes a collection by passing in an existing collection of zones.  \\n  \\n The WebPartZoneCollection class contains an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.Item%2A> property. This property allows you to locate a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control within the collection by passing in a string identifier. The zone is located by matching the string identifier to the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ID%2A> property on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone.  \\n  \\n The WebPartZoneCollection class also has several methods that are useful for examining or accessing its contents. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.Contains%2A> method determines whether a particular zone exists in the collection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.CopyTo%2A> method copies the collection to an array of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> objects. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.IndexOf%2A> method returns the index of a particular zone within the collection.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebPartZoneCollection class. The code example contains three parts: two sections of code, and an explanation of how to run the example.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is a Web page that contains three <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls, each of which contains a single server control. Although these server controls are all standard ASP.NET controls, they can act as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls at run time because they are placed within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_155_1.aspx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_155_1.aspx)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example is the partial class that contains the code to demonstrate usage of the WebPartZoneCollection class.
