It provides properties that enable you to specify the length of that segment, when it should start, how many times it will repeat, how fast time progresses in that segment, and more.       Classes that inherit from the timeline class provide additional functionality, such as animation and media playback. The following are examples of some of the different types of specialized timelines available.      -   **Animations**: An <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline> is a type of timeline that produces output values. When you associate an animation with a property, the animation updates the property's value as it plays, thereby \"animating\" it. For an introduction to animations, see [Animation Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md). For information about the different ways to apply animations, see the [Property Animation Techniques Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).      -   **MediaTimelines**: A <xref:System.Windows.Media.MediaTimeline> is a type of timeline that controls the playback of a media file.      -   **ParallelTimelines**: A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> is a type of timeline that groups other timelines.      -   **Storyboards**: A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> is a special type of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> that provides object and property targeting information for the timelines it contains. For more information about <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> objects, see the [Storyboards Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       For more information about using timelines, see the [Animation Overview](../Topic/Animation%20Overview.md). For an introduction to the timing features of timelines, see the [Timing Behaviors Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).      ## Data Binding and Animating Timelines    Most timeline properties can be data bound or animated; however, because of the way the timing system works, data bound or animated timelines do not behave like other data bound or animated objects. To understand their behavior, it helps to understand what it means to activate a timeline.       When a timeline is applied, copies are made of the timeline and its child timelines. These copies are frozen (made read-only) and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock> objects are created from them. It's these clocks that do the actual work of animating the targeted properties. If a timeline was data bound or animated, a snapshot of its current values was made when its clock was created. Even though the original timeline might continue to change, its clock does not.       For a timeline to reflect data binding or animation changes, its clock must be regenerated. Clocks are not regenerated for you automatically. The following are several ways to apply timeline changes:      -   If the timeline is or belongs to a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>, you can make it reflect changes by reapplying its storyboard using a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> or the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method. This has the side effect of also restarting the animation. In code, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Seek%2A> method to advance the storyboard back to its previous position.      -   If you applied an animation directly to a property using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A> method, call the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A> method again and pass it the animation that's been modified.      -   If you are working directly at the clock level, create and apply a new set of clocks and use them to replace the previous set of generated clocks.       For an example of a data bound animation, see the [Key Spline Animation Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160011) .      ## Using a Timeline as a Timer    A timeline's clock will only progress when there's an event hander associated with it or (in the case of an <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> object) it is associated with a property. For this reason (and others), it's not recommended that you use a Timeline as a timer.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"A timeline represents a segment of time.","pos":[0,40]},{"content":"It provides properties that enable you to specify the length of that segment, when it should start, how many times it will repeat, how fast time progresses in that segment, and more.","pos":[42,224]},{"content":"Classes that inherit from the timeline class provide additional functionality, such as animation and media playback.","pos":[231,347]},{"content":"The following are examples of some of the different types of specialized timelines available.","pos":[348,441]},{"content":"-   <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Animations<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>: An &lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline&gt;

It provides properties that enable you to specify the length of that segment, when it should start, how many times it will repeat, how fast time progresses in that segment, and more.  \\n  \\n Classes that inherit from the timeline class provide additional functionality, such as animation and media playback. The following are examples of some of the different types of specialized timelines available.  \\n  \\n-   **Animations**: An <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline> is a type of timeline that produces output values. When you associate an animation with a property, the animation updates the property's value as it plays, thereby \\\"animating\\\" it. For an introduction to animations, see [Animation Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md). For information about the different ways to apply animations, see the [Property Animation Techniques Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n-   **MediaTimelines**: A <xref:System.Windows.Media.MediaTimeline> is a type of timeline that controls the playback of a media file.  \\n  \\n-   **ParallelTimelines**: A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> is a type of timeline that groups other timelines.  \\n  \\n-   **Storyboards**: A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> is a special type of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> that provides object and property targeting information for the timelines it contains. For more information about <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> objects, see the [Storyboards Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n For more information about using timelines, see the [Animation Overview](../Topic/Animation%20Overview.md). For an introduction to the timing features of timelines, see the [Timing Behaviors Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n## Data Binding and Animating Timelines  \\n Most timeline properties can be data bound or animated; however, because of the way the timing system works, data bound or animated timelines do not behave like other data bound or animated objects. To understand their behavior, it helps to understand what it means to activate a timeline.  \\n  \\n When a timeline is applied, copies are made of the timeline and its child timelines. These copies are frozen (made read-only) and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock> objects are created from them. It's these clocks that do the actual work of animating the targeted properties. If a timeline was data bound or animated, a snapshot of its current values was made when its clock was created. Even though the original timeline might continue to change, its clock does not.  \\n  \\n For a timeline to reflect data binding or animation changes, its clock must be regenerated. Clocks are not regenerated for you automatically. The following are several ways to apply timeline changes:  \\n  \\n-   If the timeline is or belongs to a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>, you can make it reflect changes by reapplying its storyboard using a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> or the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method. This has the side effect of also restarting the animation. In code, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Seek%2A> method to advance the storyboard back to its previous position.  \\n  \\n-   If you applied an animation directly to a property using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A> method, call the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A> method again and pass it the animation that's been modified.  \\n  \\n-   If you are working directly at the clock level, create and apply a new set of clocks and use them to replace the previous set of generated clocks.  \\n  \\n For an example of a data bound animation, see the [Key Spline Animation Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160011) .  \\n  \\n## Using a Timeline as a Timer  \\n A timeline's clock will only progress when there's an event hander associated with it or (in the case of an <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> object) it is associated with a property. For this reason (and others), it's not recommended that you use a Timeline as a timer.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Windows.Localizability(System.Windows.LocalizationCategory.None, Readability=System.Windows.Readability.Unreadable)]\n\n      [System.Windows.Markup.RuntimeNameProperty(\"Name\")]\n\n      public abstract class Timeline : System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable\n  inheritance:\n  -
