Vector fonts contrast with *raster* fonts, which are simply lists. A raster font has a list for each letter of each available font size, and the lists determine, for every pixel in the letter, whether it prints.       You can enlarge or reduce vector fonts to almost any point size; however, vector fonts can slow printing because they occupy a large amount of printer memory. Also, some printers do not support TrueType fonts.       Newer printers often avoid these problems by doing the following.      -   Converting a TrueType font into an outline font, which is a generic vector font. Many printers that do not support TrueType fonts, do support outline fonts.      -   Creating a temporary raster font that looks just like a TrueType font. The printer must create a separate temporary raster font for each font size that the document uses. For that reason, if a print job uses many font sizes, the total memory that the printer uses might be greater than what a TrueType font would use.      -   Treating each text area in the document as a graphic. If a device needs to print a document that contains very little text, downloading text as a graphic can use less printer memory than downloading a font.
