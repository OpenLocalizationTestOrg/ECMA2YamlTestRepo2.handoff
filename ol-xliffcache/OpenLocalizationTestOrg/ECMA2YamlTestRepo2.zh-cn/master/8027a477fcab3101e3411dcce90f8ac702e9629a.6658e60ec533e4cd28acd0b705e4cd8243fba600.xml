Control property values can be set using expression strings; the expression strings are evaluated at run time by an expression builder and at design time by an expression editor.       When you browse the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.HtmlControlDesigner.Expressions%2A> property for a control in the design-time properties grid, the visual designer displays a dialog box to set expressions that provide the value for a control property. You can select the expression type based on a list of expression prefixes. When you select an expression prefix from the list, the visual designer uses the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ExpressionEditor> and ExpressionEditorSheet objects to evaluate and convert the expression string based on the syntax for that type of expression. The visual designer uses expression editor sheet properties to prompt for one or more strings that combine into the custom expression string.       Typically, to supply a new expression type at design time, you define a unique expression prefix and provide custom <xref:System.Web.Compilation.ExpressionBuilder> and <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ExpressionEditor> implementations. Optionally, you can provide a custom ExpressionEditorSheet implementation that defines properties that are used to form the expression. To associate an expression prefix with an expression builder and an expression editor, apply the <xref:System.Web.Compilation.ExpressionEditorAttribute> attribute and an <xref:System.Web.Compilation.ExpressionPrefixAttribute> attribute to the custom <xref:System.Web.Configuration.ExpressionBuilder> class, and then configure the expression prefix for an expression builder in the `expressionBuilders` element in the Web configuration file.       The default implementation of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ExpressionEditor.GetExpressionEditorSheet%2A> method returns a basic editor sheet, which uses a single input string to form the expression. Custom expression editors that are derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ExpressionEditor> can override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ExpressionEditor.GetExpressionEditorSheet%2A> method to return a custom editor sheet implementation. Typically, a custom editor sheet contains multiple properties that are used to build the expression string. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ExpressionEditorSheet.GetExpression%2A> method returns the resulting expression string based on the current expression properties.       For example, the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ResourceExpressionEditor> class derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ExpressionEditor> class and provides an implementation for evaluating and associating a resource string reference with a control property at design time.
