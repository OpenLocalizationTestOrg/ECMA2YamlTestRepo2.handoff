Web server controls that bind to data are referred to as data-bound controls, and the classes that facilitate that binding are called data source controls. Data source controls can represent any data source: a relational database, a file, a stream, a business object, and so on. Data source controls present data in a consistent way to data-bound controls, regardless of the source or format of the underlying data.       You implement the IDataSource interface when you want to implement your own custom ASP.NET data source control.       Any class that implements the IDataSource interface is a data source control.

This concept is that all data source controls support one or more named views on their data. The data source view object is similar to the <xref:System.Data.DataView> abstraction in the <xref:System.Data> namespace: a data-bindable, customized view of data for sorting, filtering, and other data operations that the view defines.
