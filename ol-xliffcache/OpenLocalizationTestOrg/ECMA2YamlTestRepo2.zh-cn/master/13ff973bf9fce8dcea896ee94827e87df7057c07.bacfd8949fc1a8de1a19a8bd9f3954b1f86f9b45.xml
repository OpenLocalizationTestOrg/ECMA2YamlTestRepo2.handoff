This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"The WebPartCollection class is a read-only collection of controls, typically used by <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> controls to manage sets of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.  \\n  \\n A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control uses a WebPartCollection object to keep a list of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a page, whereas a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> control uses a WebPartCollection object to track the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that it contains.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The WebPartCollection collection contains both <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and other server controls (such as user controls, custom controls, and ASP.NET controls) that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones and used as part of Web Parts applications. So, for example, if you have a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone in a page, and within it you declare a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control and the ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control, both controls will be in the WebPartCollection collection referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property.  \\n  \\n The WebPartCollection object exists so that the Web Parts control set can work with strongly typed collections. Similarly, if you want to perform mass operations on a set of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, you can get a reference to a WebPartCollection object using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property. For example, you might want to loop through all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a page and change their appearance in some way. Even though the WebPartCollection object is read-only, you can make programmatic changes to the properties of the underlying controls referenced in the collection.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebPartCollection object on a Web Parts page.
