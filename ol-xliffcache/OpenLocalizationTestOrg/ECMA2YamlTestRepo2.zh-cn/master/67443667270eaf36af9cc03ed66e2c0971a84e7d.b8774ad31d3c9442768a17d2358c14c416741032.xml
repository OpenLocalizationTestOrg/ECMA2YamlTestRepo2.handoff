The control plots two curves along with a legend. The `ChartControlAccessibleObject` class, which derives from `ControlAccessibleObject`, is used in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateAccessibilityInstance%2A> method to provide custom accessible information for the chart control. Because the chart legend is not an actual <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> -based control, but instead is drawn by the chart control, it does not any built-in accessible information. Because of this, the `ChartControlAccessibleObject` class overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.GetChild%2A> method to return the `CurveLegendAccessibleObject` that represents accessible information for each part of the legend. When an accessible-aware application uses this control, the control can provide the necessary accessible information.  \\n  \\n This example demonstrates using the AccessibleSelection enumeration with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.Select%2A> method. See the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject> class overview for the complete code example.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.a_11_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.a_11_1.cs)]\\n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject#4](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.a_11_1.cpp)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Flags]\n\n      public enum AccessibleSelection\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.AddSelection\n  id: AddSelection\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AddSelection\n  nameWithType: AccessibleSelection.AddSelection\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.AddSelection\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Adds the object to the selection.\n  syntax:\n    content: AddSelection\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.ExtendSelection\n  id: ExtendSelection\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: ExtendSelection\n  nameWithType: AccessibleSelection.ExtendSelection\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.ExtendSelection\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Selects all objects between the anchor and the selected object.\n  syntax:\n    content: ExtendSelection\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.None\n  id: None\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: None\n  nameWithType: AccessibleSelection.None\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.None\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The selection or focus of an object is unchanged.\n  syntax:\n    content: None\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.RemoveSelection\n  id: RemoveSelection\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: RemoveSelection\n  nameWithType: AccessibleSelection.RemoveSelection\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.RemoveSelection\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Removes the object from the selection.\n  syntax:\n    content: RemoveSelection\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.TakeFocus\n  id: TakeFocus\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: TakeFocus\n  nameWithType: AccessibleSelection.TakeFocus\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleSelection.TakeFocus\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Assigns focus to an object and makes it the anchor, which is the starting point for the selection.
