A ChangeMonitor instance monitors changes in the state of data which a cache item depends on. For example, the item can be a file or data entity whose contents are cached. If the file or data entity is updated, the associated cache entry must be changed also. Common items that can be monitored include data entities (such as database fields, values, rows, or tables), another cache entry, and files and file attributes.       A dependency change is a change in the state of a dependency. In a typical cache implementation, after a ChangeMonitor instance notifies the cache that a dependency has changed, the cache performs the required action, such as invalidating the inserted cache entry.       Derived ChangeMonitor classes can be customized to monitor dependency changes for specific different data stores. For example, there are cache implementations for a file system, physical memory, or a database. The ChangeMonitor class examines changes that occur outside the cache, and then alerts the cache that changes have occurred.

A ChangeMonitor instance monitors changes in the state of data which a cache item depends on. For example, the item can be a file or data entity whose contents are cached. If the file or data entity is updated, the associated cache entry must be changed also. Common items that can be monitored include data entities (such as database fields, values, rows, or tables), another cache entry, and files and file attributes.  \\n  \\n A dependency change is a change in the state of a dependency. In a typical cache implementation, after a ChangeMonitor instance notifies the cache that a dependency has changed, the cache performs the required action, such as invalidating the inserted cache entry.  \\n  \\n Derived ChangeMonitor classes can be customized to monitor dependency changes for specific different data stores. For example, there are cache implementations for a file system, physical memory, or a database. The ChangeMonitor class examines changes that occur outside the cache, and then alerts the cache that changes have occurred.  \\n  \\n The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] includes the following classes that derive from ChangeMonitor class:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.CacheEntryChangeMonitor>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.FileChangeMonitor>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.SqlChangeMonitor>  \\n  \\n Each of these classes works with different types of dependencies.

If you associate one or more change monitors with the cache item, you pass a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPolicy> instance with a populated change monitors property to the cache item.
