The example calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A> method when the drag action starts. The drag action starts if the mouse has moved more than <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.DragSize%2A?displayProperty=fullName> from the mouse location during the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.IndexFromPoint%2A> method is used to determine the index of the item to drag during the `MouseDown` event.  \\n  \\n The example also demonstrates using custom cursors for the drag-and-drop operation. The example assumes that two cursor files, `3dwarro.cur` and `3dwno.cur`, exist in the application directory, for the custom drag and no-drop cursors, respectively. The custom cursors will be used if the `UseCustomCursorsCheck`<xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> is checked. The custom cursors are set in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.GiveFeedback> event handler.  \\n  \\n The keyboard state is evaluated in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragOver> event handler for the right `ListBox`, to determine what the drag operation will be based upon state of the SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, or CTRL+ALT keys. The location in the `ListBox` where the drop would occur is also determined during the `DragOver` event. If the data to drop is not a `String`, then the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs.Effect%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragDropEffects?displayProperty=fullName>. Finally, the status of the drop is displayed in the `DropLocationLabel`<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label>.  \\n  \\n The data to drop for the right `ListBox` is determined in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop> event handler and the `String` value is added at the appropriate place in the `ListBox`. If the drag operation moves outside the bounds of the form, then the drag-and-drop operation is canceled in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.QueryContinueDrag> event handler.  \\n  \\n This code excerpt demonstrates using the DragAction enumeration. See the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A> method for the complete code example.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop#6](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.d_106_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.d_106_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.d_106_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public enum DragAction\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Cancel\n  id: Cancel\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Cancel\n  nameWithType: DragAction.Cancel\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Cancel\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The operation is canceled with no drop message.\n  syntax:\n    content: Cancel\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Continue\n  id: Continue\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Continue\n  nameWithType: DragAction.Continue\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Continue\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The operation will continue.\n  syntax:\n    content: Continue\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Drop\n  id: Drop\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Drop\n  nameWithType: DragAction.Drop\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Drop\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The operation will stop with a drop.\n  syntax:\n    content: Drop\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Enum\n  isExternal: false\n  name: System.Enum\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Cancel\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Cancel\n  nameWithType: DragAction.Cancel\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Cancel\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms\n  isExternal: false\n  name: DragAction\n  nameWithType: DragAction\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Continue\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Continue\n  nameWithType: DragAction.Continue\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Continue\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Drop\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Drop\n  nameWithType: DragAction.Drop\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.DragAction.Drop\n"}
