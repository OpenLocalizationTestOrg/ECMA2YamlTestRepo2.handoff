The data emitted is referred to as user data.

A UserTrackingLocation defines the matching parameters for such a location by specifying the type of the user data, the type of the activity from which it must be emitted, a collection of conditions that can more precisely qualify an instance or instances of this activity, an optional key name with which the user data must be associated, whether derived types of the user data should be matched, and whether user data emitted from activities derived from the type of the specified activity should be matched.      > [!NOTE] >  A single UserTrackingLocation may refer to more than one actual location in the potential execution path of a workflow instance.

This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"> [!NOTE]\\n>  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]  \\n  \\n An activity designer or a workflow designer may use any of the overloaded <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.Activity.TrackData%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.ActivityExecutionContext.TrackData%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to instrument the workflow to emit data to the runtime tracking infrastructure as a user event. The data emitted is referred to as user data. Unlike activity status events, and workflow status events, which occur only on activity or workflow status changes, user events can occur at any location that is instrumented in a workflow. A UserTrackingLocation defines the matching parameters for such a location by specifying the type of the user data, the type of the activity from which it must be emitted, a collection of conditions that can more precisely qualify an instance or instances of this activity, an optional key name with which the user data must be associated, whether derived types of the user data should be matched, and whether user data emitted from activities derived from the type of the specified activity should be matched.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  A single UserTrackingLocation may refer to more than one actual location in the potential execution path of a workflow instance.  \\n  \\n You may add a UserTrackingLocation to either <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint.MatchingLocations%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint.ExcludedLocations%2A?displayProperty=fullName> in order to define the match parameters for a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackPoint> in a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile>.  \\n  \\n There are three general conditions which must be met in the following order for the UserTrackingLocation to be matched by the runtime tracking infrastructure: the activity that has emitted a user event must match the set of activities specified by <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ActivityType%2A>, <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ActivityTypeName%2A>, <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.Conditions%2A>, and <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.MatchDerivedActivityTypes%2A>; the key, if one exists, associated with the user data must match <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.KeyName%2A>; and, the type of the user data emitted by the user event must match the set of user data types specified by <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ArgumentType%2A>, <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ArgumentTypeName%2A>, and <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.MatchDerivedArgumentTypes%2A>. Only if all three of these conditions are met, does the runtime tracking infrastructure consider the UserTrackingLocation matched.  \\n  \\n To configure a UserTrackingLocation, you must set either <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ArgumentTypeName%2A> or <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ArgumentType%2A> to specify the type of the user data to be matched and either <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ActivityTypeName%2A> or <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ActivityType%2A> to specify the type of the activity from which the user data must be emitted to be matched. You may add <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.ActivityTrackingCondition> objects to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.Conditions%2A> to more completely qualify the activity from which the user data must be emitted. You may set <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.MatchDerivedArgumentTypes%2A> to specify that user data derived from the user data type specified by <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ArgumentTypeName%2A> or <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ArgumentType%2A> should be matched, and you may set <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.MatchDerivedActivityTypes%2A> to specify that user data emitted from activities derived from the activity type specified by <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ActivityTypeName%2A> or <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.ActivityType%2A> should be matched.  \\n  \\n You may set <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.KeyName%2A> to specify that only user data associated with the specified key name should be matched for this UserTrackingLocation. If <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.UserTrackingLocation.KeyName%2A> is a null reference (`Nothing` in Visual Basic), the runtime tracking structure will not try to match the key associated with the user data.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Obsolete(\"The System.Workflow.* types are deprecated.
