The Low deserialization level helps protect against deserialization attacks by deserializing only the types associated with the most basic remoting functionality. The Full deserialization level supports automatic deserialization of all types that remoting supports in all situations. For a list of the .NET Framework remoting types that Low and Full support, see [&#91;\\\\<topic://cpconAutomaticDeserializationInNETRemoting>&#93;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/313a0e88-5b2b-4a17-8391-0ddf9f7a787b).  \\n  \\n You can set the members of this enumeration programmatically or by using an application configuration file. For examples, see [&#91;\\\\<topic://cpconAutomaticDeserializationInNETRemoting>&#93;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/313a0e88-5b2b-4a17-8391-0ddf9f7a787b).  \\n  \\n> [!CAUTION]\\n>  Do not assume that controlling deserialization is the only security your application requires. In distributed applications, even a high degree of control over serialization might not prevent malicious clients from intercepting the communication and using it in some way, even if that is merely showing data to others. Therefore, although the Low deserialization level provides some protection against certain types of attack based upon automatic deserialization, you must still evaluate whether to use authentication and encryption to help protect the confidentiality of your data.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public enum TypeFilterLevel\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.TypeFilterLevel.Full\n  id: Full\n  parent: System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.TypeFilterLevel\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Full\n  nameWithType: TypeFilterLevel.Full\n  fullName: System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.TypeFilterLevel.Full\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - mscorlib\n  namespace: System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters\n  summary: The full deserialization level for .NET Framework remoting.
