The Configuration class instance represents the merged view of the configuration settings from all of the configuration files that apply to a specific physical entity, such as a computer, or to a logical entity, such as an application or a Web site. The logical entity can exist on the local computer or on a remote server. For information about configuration files, see [Configuring Apps](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) and [ASP.NET Configuration Files](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n When no configuration file exists for a specified entity, the Configuration object represents the default configuration settings as defined by the Machine.config file.  \\n  \\n You can get a Configuration object by using the following classes:  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager> class, if your entity is a client application.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager> class, if your entity is a Web application.  \\n  \\n The names of the methods that return a Configuration object begin with \\\"Open\\\".  \\n  \\n You can also generate a configuration file that represents the configuration settings in a Configuration object. To do this, use one of the following methods:  \\n  \\n-   Call the <xref:System.Configuration.Configuration.Save%2A> method to create a new configuration file.  \\n  \\n-   Call the <xref:System.Configuration.Configuration.SaveAs%2A> method to generate a new configuration file at another location.  \\n  \\n The names of the methods that create configuration files begin with \\\"Save\\\".  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To enable access to configuration settings on a remote computer, use the Aspnet_regiis command-line tool.
