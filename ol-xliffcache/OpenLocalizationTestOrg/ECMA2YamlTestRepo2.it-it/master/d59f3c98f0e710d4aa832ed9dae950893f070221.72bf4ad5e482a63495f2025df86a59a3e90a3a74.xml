For more information, see the topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class.  \\n  \\n Besides containing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, a WebPartZone control also provides a common UI for the controls it contains. This common UI, known collectively as chrome, consists of the peripheral UI elements on all the controls, such as the border, title, header and footer, style characteristics, and verbs (UI actions that a user can carry out on a control, such as close or minimize).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Internet Explorer might render the height of a WebPartZone or its contained controls in an unexpected way, depending on the orientation of the zone. For more details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Height%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n The WebPartZone class derives most of its behavior from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> classes; it adds only one unique member, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone.ZoneTemplate%2A> property. This property references an <xref:System.Web.UI.ITemplate> object, which is a template that allows page developers to define the controls in a zone statically by using a `<zonetemplate>` element in the declarative markup of an .aspx page.  \\n  \\n## Accessibility  \\n The markup rendered by default for this control might not conform to accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG) priority 1 guidelines. For details about accessibility support for this control, see [ASP.NET Controls and Accessibility](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebPartZone control in a Web Parts page. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n The first part of the example shows a custom class that inherits from the WebPartZone class, and that sets two of the base zone properties in the constructor.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZone_Overview#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_213_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZone_Overview#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_213_1.cs)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the example shows a page that contains the custom WebPartZone control. Notice that the page requires a special `Register` directive near the top of the page to reference the assembly that contains the custom zone. The page also contains an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, which is required on every Web Parts page. The `<cc1:MyWebPartZone>` element, which represents the custom WebPartZone control, contains a standard ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control. Because it is contained within a WebPartZone zone, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control will be wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> control at run time, which enables it to act as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZone_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_213_2.aspx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZone_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_213_2.aspx)]  \\n  \\n Examine the declarative markup for the custom WebPartZone control. Notice that you can set various zone-level properties in the markup, as shown in the following code example.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is very important to note the use of the `<zonetemplate>` element. This element, as described in the Remarks section, is required within a WebPartZone zone to wrap the static <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that are declared in a page.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZone_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_213_3.aspx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZone_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_213_3.aspx)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.Designer(\"System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneDesigner, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\")]\n\n      [System.Web.UI.SupportsEventValidation]\n\n      public class WebPartZone : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase\n  inheritance:\n  -

If a user loads the page and drags `User1` into the second zone, then `User1` is still part of the collection that is returned by calling the GetInitialWebParts method for the first zone, because it is declared in that zone. But at run time, when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control loads the personalization data, `User1` actually appears in the second zone where the user dragged it.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: protected override System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartCollection GetInitialWebParts ();\n    parameters: []\n    return:\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartCollection\n      description: A <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartCollection\"></xref> that contains all the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart\"></xref> or other server controls contained in the zone's template.\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone.GetInitialWebParts*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone.OnInit(System.EventArgs)\n  id: OnInit(System.EventArgs)\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OnInit(EventArgs)\n  nameWithType: WebPartZone.OnInit(EventArgs)\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone.OnInit(EventArgs)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Overrides the base method to indicate that the zone has successfully been registered with the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\"></xref> control.\n  syntax:\n    content: protected override void OnInit (EventArgs e);\n    parameters:\n    - id: e\n      type: System.EventArgs\n      description: An <xref:System.EventArgs> that contains the event data.\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone.OnInit*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone.ZoneTemplate\n  id: ZoneTemplate\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: ZoneTemplate\n  nameWithType: WebPartZone.ZoneTemplate\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone.ZoneTemplate\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Gets or sets a reference to an <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.ITemplate\"></xref> instance that contains the controls declared in the markup of a Web page.\n  remarks: \"The ZoneTemplate property refers to an <xref:System.Web.UI.ITemplate> instance within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control.
