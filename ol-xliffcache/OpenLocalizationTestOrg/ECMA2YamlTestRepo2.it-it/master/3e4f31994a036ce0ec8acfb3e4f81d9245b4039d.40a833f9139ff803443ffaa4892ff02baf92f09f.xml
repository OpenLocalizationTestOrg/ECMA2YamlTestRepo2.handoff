This class cannot be instantiated. To send a keystroke to a class and immediately continue with the flow of your program, use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send%2A>. To wait for any processes started by the keystroke, use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait%2A>.       Each key is represented by one or more characters. To specify a single keyboard character, use the character itself. For example, to represent the letter A, pass in the string \"A\" to the method. To represent more than one character, append each additional character to the one preceding it. To represent the letters A, B, and C, specify the parameter as \"ABC\".       The plus sign (+), caret (^), percent sign (%), tilde (~), and parentheses () have special meanings to SendKeys. To specify one of these characters, enclose it within braces ({}). For example, to specify the plus sign, use \"{+}\". To specify brace characters, use \"{{}\" and \"{}}\". Brackets ([ ]) have no special meaning to SendKeys, but you must enclose them in braces.

The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys> class tries to use the previous implementation first, and if that fails, uses the new implementation. As a result, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys> class may behave differently on different operating systems. Additionally, when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys> class uses the new implementation, the SendWait method will not wait for messages to be processed when they are sent to another process.  \\n>   \\n>  If your application relies on consistent behavior regardless of the operating system, you can force the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys> class to use the new implementation by adding the following application setting to your app.config file.  \\n>   \\n>  `<appSettings>`  \\n>   \\n>  `<add key=\\\"SendKeys\\\" value=\\\"SendInput\\\"/>`  \\n>   \\n>  `</appSettings>`  \\n>   \\n>  To force the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys> class to use the previous implementation, use the value `\\\"JournalHook\\\"` instead.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public static void SendWait (string keys);\n    parameters:\n    - id: keys\n      type: System.String\n      description: The string of keystrokes to send.\n  overload: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: System.Object\n- uid: System.InvalidOperationException\n  isExternal: true\n  name: System.InvalidOperationException\n- uid: System.ArgumentException\n  isExternal: true\n  name: System.ArgumentException\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Flush\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Flush()\n  nameWithType: SendKeys.Flush()\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Flush()\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send(System.String)\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Send(String)\n  nameWithType: SendKeys.Send(String)\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send(String)\n- uid: System.String\n  parent: System\n  isExternal: true\n  name: String\n  nameWithType: String\n  fullName: System.String\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait(System.String)\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys\n  isExternal: false\n  name: SendWait(String)\n  nameWithType: SendKeys.SendWait(String)\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait(String)\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Flush*\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Flush\n  nameWithType: SendKeys.Flush\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send*\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Send\n  nameWithType: SendKeys.Send\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait*\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys\n  isExternal: false\n  name: SendWait\n  nameWithType: SendKeys.SendWait\n"}
