For more information, see [Collections](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n The Visual Basic `Collection` object provides a convenient way to refer to a related group of items as a single object. The items, or *elements*, in a collection need only be related by the fact that they exist in the collection. Elements of a collection do not have to share the same data type.  \\n  \\n You can create a collection the same way you create other objects, as the following example illustrates.  \\n  \\n```  \\nDim coll As New Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection()  \\n```  \\n  \\n Once you have created a collection, you can do any of the following:  \\n  \\n-   Add an element with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection.Add%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Remove an element with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection.Remove%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Remove all elements with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection.Clear%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Find out how many elements the collection contains with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection.Count%2A> property.  \\n  \\n-   Check whether a specific element is present with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection.Contains%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Return a specific element from the collection with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection.Item%2A> property.  \\n  \\n-   Iterate through the entire collection with the [For Each...Next Statement](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n    > [!NOTE]\\n    >  Although the Visual Basic `Collection` object has functionality identical to the `Collection` object in Visual Basic 6.0, the two cannot interoperate in a COM environment.  \\n  \\n    > [!CAUTION]\\n    >  Iterating through a Visual Basic `Collection` is not a thread-safe procedure. Even if the collection is synchronized, other threads can still modify the collection, causing the enumerator to throw an exception. To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, either lock the collection or catch the exceptions resulting from changes made by other threads. For more information on locking a programming element, see [SyncLock Statement](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example creates the `Collection` object `names` and a dialog box with which a user can add objects (names) to the collection. It then displays the names in the collection, and finally empties the collection without disposing of the `Collection` object itself.  \\n  \\n To see how this works, choose the **Add Class** command from the **Project** menu and declare a public variable called `instanceName` at the module level of `nameClass` (type `Public instanceName`) to hold the names of each instance. Leave the default name as `nameClass`. Copy and paste the following code into the **General** section of another module, and then start it with the statement `classNamer` in another procedure.

Therefore, using `foreach` is recommended, instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.  \\n  \\n Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.  \\n  \\n Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. The <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> method also brings the enumerator back to this position. At this position, the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> property is undefined. Therefore, you must call the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> method to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the same object until either <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is called. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> sets <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the next element.  \\n  \\n If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returns `false`.

If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator is irrecoverably invalidated and its behavior is undefined.  \\n  \\n The enumerator does not have exclusive access to the collection; therefore, enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread-safe procedure.
