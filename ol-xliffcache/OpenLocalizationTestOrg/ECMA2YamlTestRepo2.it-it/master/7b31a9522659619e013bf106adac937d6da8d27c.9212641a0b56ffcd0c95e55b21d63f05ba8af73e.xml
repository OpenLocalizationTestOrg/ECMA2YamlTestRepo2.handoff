Notice that the class derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class and implements the IWebEditable interface, providing specific implementations for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts%2A> method and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.WebBrowsableObject%2A> property. Notice also that nested within the `TextDisplayWebPart` class is a private, custom `TextDisplayEditorPart` class that derives from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> class. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebEditable_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_204_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_IWebEditable_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_204_1.cs)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example is a Web page that hosts the custom control. Notice that although an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control is declared in the markup of the page, the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control need not be referenced there, because it can be added programmatically at run time.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebEditable_Overview#7](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_204_2.aspx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_IWebEditable_Overview#7](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_204_2.aspx)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is a user control that enables a user to switch the page into edit mode. Notice that the user control is referenced in the hosting Web page. For a full description of how to create this user control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_IWebEditable_Overview#8](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_204_3.ascx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebEditable_Overview#8](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_204_3.ascx)]  \\n  \\n To run the code example, load the hosting Web page in a browser, add some text to the text box, and click the **Set Label Content** button to update the label in the control. To switch the page into edit mode, select **Edit** from the drop-down list containing the display modes. To display the UI from the custom `TextDisplayEditorPart` control, click the verbs menu drop-down arrow on the `TextDisplayWebPart` control, and select **Edit**. In the editing UI, you can use the drop-down list containing the font styles to update the text style for the label in the `TextDisplayWebPart` control. You must click **Browse Mode** in the display modes drop-down list to return the page to normal view and confirm that the text in the label now has the font style you selected while in edit mode.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public interface IWebEditable\n  implements: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts\n  id: CreateEditorParts\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: CreateEditorParts()\n  nameWithType: IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts()\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts()\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Returns a collection of custom <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart\"></xref> controls associated with a server control that implements the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable\"></xref> interface.\n  remarks: \"The CreateEditorParts method enables you to create a collection of all the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls associated with your custom control, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, or user control, and return them as an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartCollection> object.
