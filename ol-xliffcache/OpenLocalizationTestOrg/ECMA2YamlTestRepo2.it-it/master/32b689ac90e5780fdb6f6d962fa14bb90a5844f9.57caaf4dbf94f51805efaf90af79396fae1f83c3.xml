SecurityEnabled provides a way for administrators to disable code access security. When code access security is disabled, all code access demands succeed. Effectively, this grants all code `FullTrust`. Disabling code access security bypasses the security system so that code might perform slightly better than the equivalent security policy granting `FullTrust` to all code. This property does not disable role-based security; therefore, <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PrincipalPermission> demands are not affected.      > [!CAUTION] >  Disabling code access security makes the system vulnerable to attacks by malicious code such as viruses and worms. Disabling code access security does not automatically block managed code from running in any way. It only causes managed code to run without restriction by the code access security system, and should only be done with the most extreme caution. Turning off security to gain extra performance should only be done when other security measures have been taken to help protect system security. Examples of other security precautions include disconnecting from public networks, physically securing computers, and so on.
