The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control in the example displays optional node tags alongside the standard node labels. Node tags are specified using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Tag%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control also uses custom colors, including a custom highlight color.  \\n  \\n You can customize most of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> colors by setting color properties, but the selection highlight color is not available as a property. Additionally, the default selection highlight rectangle extends only around a node label. Owner drawing must be used to draw the node tags and to draw a customized highlight rectangle large enough to include a node tag.  \\n  \\n For the complete example, see the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawNode?displayProperty=fullName> reference topic.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[TreeViewOwnerDraw#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.t_34_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cpp[TreeViewOwnerDraw#2](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.t_34_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-cs[TreeViewOwnerDraw#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.t_34_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public enum TreeViewDrawMode\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode.Normal\n  id: Normal\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Normal\n  nameWithType: TreeViewDrawMode.Normal\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode.Normal\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The <xref href=\"System.Windows.Forms.TreeView\"></xref> is drawn by the operating system.\n  syntax:\n    content: Normal\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode.OwnerDrawAll\n  id: OwnerDrawAll\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OwnerDrawAll\n  nameWithType: TreeViewDrawMode.OwnerDrawAll\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode.OwnerDrawAll\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: All elements of a <xref href=\"System.Windows.Forms.TreeView\"></xref> node are drawn manually, including icons, checkboxes, plus and minus signs, and lines connecting the nodes.\n  syntax:\n    content: OwnerDrawAll\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode.OwnerDrawText\n  id: OwnerDrawText\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OwnerDrawText\n  nameWithType: TreeViewDrawMode.OwnerDrawText\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode.OwnerDrawText\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The label portion of the <xref href=\"System.Windows.Forms.TreeView\"></xref> nodes are drawn manually.
