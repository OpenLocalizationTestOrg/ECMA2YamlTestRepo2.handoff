In this case, you should still make sure that your development environment catches and displays such exceptions to you or makes use of tracing to discover the problem. For more information about tracing, see [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n After the response message has been sent, all <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IErrorHandler.HandleError%2A> implementations are called in the same order.  \\n  \\n Typically, an IErrorHandler implementation is added to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.ChannelDispatcher.ErrorHandlers%2A> property on the service (and the client in the case of duplex communication).  \\n  \\n You can add the IErrorHandler to the runtime by implementing a behavior (either an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IServiceBehavior?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IEndpointBehavior?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IContractBehavior?displayProperty=fullName>, or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior?displayProperty=fullName> object) and use the behavior programmatically, from a configuration file or with a custom attribute to attach your IErrorHandler.  \\n  \\n For more information about using behaviors to modify the runtime, see [Configuring and Extending the Runtime with Behaviors](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates a service that implements IErrorHandler that returns only <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultException%601> of type `GreetingFault` when a service method throws a managed exception.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[IErrorHandler#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/ierrorhandler.client/ierrorhandler.vb#6)]\\n [!code-cs[IErrorHandler#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/ierrorhandler.client/ierrorhandler.cs#6)]  \\n  \\n The following code example shows how to use a service behavior to add the IErrorHandler implementation to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.ChannelDispatcher.ErrorHandlers%2A> property.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[IErrorHandler#7](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/ierrorhandler.client/ierrorhandler.vb#7)]\\n [!code-cs[IErrorHandler#7](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/ierrorhandler.client/ierrorhandler.cs#7)]  \\n  \\n The following code example shows how to configure the service to load the service behavior using an application configuration file.
