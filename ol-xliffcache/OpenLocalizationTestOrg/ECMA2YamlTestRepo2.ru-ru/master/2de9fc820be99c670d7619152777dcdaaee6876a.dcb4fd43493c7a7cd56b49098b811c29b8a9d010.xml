You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).       The ArrayList class is designed to hold heterogeneous collections of objects. However, it does not always offer the best performance. Instead, we recommend the following:      -   For a heterogeneous collection of objects, use the `List<Object>` (in C#) or `List(Of Object)` (in Visual Basic) type.      -   For a homogeneous collection of objects, use the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> class.       See the \"Performance Considerations\" section in the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> reference topic for a discussion of the relative performance of these classes.       The ArrayList is not guaranteed to be sorted.  You must sort the ArrayList by calling its <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Sort%2A> method prior to performing operations (such as <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.BinarySearch%2A>) that require the ArrayList to be sorted. To maintain a collection that is automatically sorted as new elements are added, you can use the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.SortedSet%601> class.       The capacity of an ArrayList is the number of elements the ArrayList can hold. As elements are added to an ArrayList, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation. The capacity can be decreased by calling <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.TrimToSize%2A> or by setting the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Capacity%2A> property explicitly.       For very large ArrayList objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the `enabled` attribute of the  configuration element to `true` in the run-time environment.       Elements in this collection can be accessed using an integer index.  Indexes in this collection are zero-based.       The ArrayList collection accepts `null` as a valid value. It also allows duplicate elements.       Using multidimensional arrays as elements in an ArrayList collection is not supported.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"extradata":"MT","nodes":[{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&gt; [!NOTE]</ph> &gt;

You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \\n  \\n The ArrayList class is designed to hold heterogeneous collections of objects. However, it does not always offer the best performance. Instead, we recommend the following:  \\n  \\n-   For a heterogeneous collection of objects, use the `List<Object>` (in C#) or `List(Of Object)` (in Visual Basic) type.  \\n  \\n-   For a homogeneous collection of objects, use the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> class.  \\n  \\n See the \\\"Performance Considerations\\\" section in the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> reference topic for a discussion of the relative performance of these classes.  \\n  \\n The ArrayList is not guaranteed to be sorted.  You must sort the ArrayList by calling its <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Sort%2A> method prior to performing operations (such as <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.BinarySearch%2A>) that require the ArrayList to be sorted. To maintain a collection that is automatically sorted as new elements are added, you can use the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.SortedSet%601> class.  \\n  \\n The capacity of an ArrayList is the number of elements the ArrayList can hold. As elements are added to an ArrayList, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation. The capacity can be decreased by calling <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.TrimToSize%2A> or by setting the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Capacity%2A> property explicitly.  \\n  \\n For very large ArrayList objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the `enabled` attribute of the  configuration element to `true` in the run-time environment.  \\n  \\n Elements in this collection can be accessed using an integer index.  Indexes in this collection are zero-based.  \\n  \\n The ArrayList collection accepts `null` as a valid value. It also allows duplicate elements.  \\n  \\n Using multidimensional arrays as elements in an ArrayList collection is not supported.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how to create and initialize an ArrayList and how to display its values.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic ArrayList Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.collections.arr_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-cs[Classic ArrayList Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.collections.arr_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic ArrayList Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.collections.arr_1.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerDisplay(\"Count = {Count}\")]\n\n      [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerTypeProxy(typeof(System.Collections.ArrayList/ArrayListDebugView))]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public class ArrayList : ICloneable, System.Collections.IList\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements:\n  - System.Collections.IList\n  - System.ICloneable\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Collections.ArrayList.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Collections.ArrayList\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: ArrayList()\n  nameWithType: ArrayList.ArrayList()\n  fullName: System.Collections.ArrayList.ArrayList()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - mscorlib\n  namespace: System.Collections\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Collections.ArrayList\"></xref> class that is empty and has the default initial capacity.\n  remarks: \"The capacity of an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> is the number of elements that the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> can hold.
