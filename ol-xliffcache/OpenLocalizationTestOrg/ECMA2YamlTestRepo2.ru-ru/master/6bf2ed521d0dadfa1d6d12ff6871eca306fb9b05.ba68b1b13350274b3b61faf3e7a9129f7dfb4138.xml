To avoid performance issues when you apply a large number of clocks using Compose, you should remove composing clocks from the animated property after they complete. There are several ways to remove a clock:      -   To remove all clocks from a property, use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.ApplyAnimationClock%28System.Windows.DependencyProperty%2CSystem.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock%29> or <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%28System.Windows.DependencyProperty%2CSystem.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline%29> method of the animated object. Specify the property being animated as the first parameter, and `null` as the second. This will remove all animation clocks from the property.      -   To remove a specific <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> from a list of clocks, use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.Controller%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> to retrieve a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController>, then call the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController.Remove%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController>. This is typically done in the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.Completed> event handler for a clock. Note that only root clocks can be controlled by a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController>; the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.Controller%2A> property of a child clock returns `null`.

This is primarily an issue for animations on objects that have a long lifetime.  When an object is garbage collected, its clocks will also be disconnected and garbage collected.
