To access the name/value pair values for the key field or fields, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Keys%2A> property.  \\n  \\n The Values property returns an object that implements the <xref:System.Collections.Specialized.IOrderedDictionary> interface. The object contains <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryEntry> objects that represent the non-key fields.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  As a shortcut, you can also use the indexer of the <xref:System.Collections.Specialized.IOrderedDictionary> object to access the field values. The advantage in using the indexer is that it returns field values directly.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use the Values property to access the values of the non-key fields of the record being deleted.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[DetailsViewDeleteEventArgsCodeInline#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_1285_1.aspx)]\\n [!code-cs[DetailsViewDeleteEventArgsCodeInline#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_1285_1.aspx)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.Collections.Specialized.IOrderedDictionary Values { get; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Collections.Specialized.IOrderedDictionary\n      description: A <xref href=\"System.Collections.Specialized.IOrderedDictionary\"></xref> that contains a dictionary of the non-key field name/value pairs for the item to delete.\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Values*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\nreferences:\n- uid: System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.#ctor(System.Int32)\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs(Int32)\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs(Int32)\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs(Int32)\n- uid: System.Int32\n  parent: System\n  isExternal: true\n  name: Int32\n  nameWithType: Int32\n  fullName: System.Int32\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Keys\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Keys\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Keys\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Keys\n- uid: System.Collections.Specialized.IOrderedDictionary\n  parent: System.Collections.Specialized\n  isExternal: false\n  name: IOrderedDictionary\n  nameWithType: IOrderedDictionary\n  fullName: System.Collections.Specialized.IOrderedDictionary\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.RowIndex\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: RowIndex\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.RowIndex\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.RowIndex\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Values\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Values\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Values\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Values\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.#ctor*\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Keys*\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Keys\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Keys\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.RowIndex*\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: RowIndex\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.RowIndex\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Values*\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Values\n  nameWithType: DetailsViewDeleteEventArgs.Values\n"}
