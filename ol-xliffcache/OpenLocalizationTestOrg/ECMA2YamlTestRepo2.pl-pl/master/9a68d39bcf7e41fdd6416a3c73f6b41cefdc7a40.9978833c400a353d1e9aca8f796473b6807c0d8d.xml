Zones are rendered in a browser as HTML tables.       The WebZone class is the base class for all Web Parts zones. A zone control is a composite control designed to contain other controls, hence the WebZone class inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControl> class. Together with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> controls (or other user or server controls that can be placed in zones), zone controls derived from the WebZone base class form the essential building blocks of a Web Parts application.       A critical role of Web Parts zones is to enable full Web Parts functionality for the controls they contain. Every Web Parts page contains at least one zone, and a zone can contain zero or more part controls. Zones are required for Web Parts functionality. Without zones, even controls that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class can have very little Web Parts functionality. Conversely, because of the design of the Web Parts control set, you can place ordinary ASP.NET controls, server controls, or user controls into a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone (which derives from WebZone), and by virtue of being in the zone, these ordinary server controls are enable to act as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls at run time. For details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class.      > [!NOTE] >  It is possible to add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls to a page outside of a zone, but in that case they simply function as ordinary server controls.       There are two broad categories of zones in the Web Parts control set, all of which inherit from the base WebZone class.      -   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones. These contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and other server and user) controls, and form the primary UI of Web Parts pages that users interact with most of the time.      -   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones. These zones provide special views of a Web Parts page that enable users to modify (personalize) the content, layout, appearance, behavior, and properties of controls contained in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones on a Web Parts page. For example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> zone is a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> that provides a catalog view of a page, enabling users to add and remove server controls. An <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone is another type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> that provides an editing view of a page, enabling users to modify and edit the layout of the page, along with the properties, appearance, and behavior of the controls.       Each zone in the Web Parts control set is designed to contain a corresponding type of control derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> class, with the part controls serving as the main content and primary UI of the zone. Zone types in the Web Parts control set, along with the corresponding types of part controls they contain, are shown in the following table.      |Part control type|Zone type|   |-----------------------|---------------|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and server and user controls, which are wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> at run time)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> )|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> (several derived controls are provided with the Web Parts control set, and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls can be developed)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> )|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> (several derived controls are provided with the Web Parts control set, and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls can be developed)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> )|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> (connection controls are unique in that they are not part controls that inherit from the base class)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> (inherits directly from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> )|       All zones in the Web Parts control have basic, common user interface elements that they inherit from the base WebZone class. Not all these elements are visible on every zone, but each zone type is capable of having these common, zone-related UI elements, as described in the following table.      |Zone section|Description|   |------------------|-----------------|   |Header|The top section of a zone. It includes header text, which can include a title for the zone; style attributes (such as a border or background color) that distinguish the header; and zone-level verbs (represented by buttons, hyperlinks, or images) that users can click to perform UI actions that apply to the entire zone, such as closing a zone. Several WebZone properties, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasHeader%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderStyle%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderText%2A>, relate to the header area of a zone. If there are zone-level verbs in the zone, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbStyle%2A> properties apply to them. Note that these two verb properties apply to zone-level verbs only, not to verbs in the individual part controls contained in the zone. Headers are not present in every type of zone; typically they appear in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones where there is a need to have a common header area with text and a verb, such as a close verb.|   |Body|The main contents section of a zone. Every zone that derives from WebZone has a body section. For all types of zones in the Web Parts control set, the body of the zone contains the designated type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> controls (or other server controls) that correspond to a zone type, as indicated in the previous table. Various members of the WebZone class affect the contents of the body section, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.BackImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> properties. If the body section is empty, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A> message can be displayed in certain situations.|   |Chrome|The common UI elements rendered for each part control in a zone. This is distinct from a discussion of style attributes that apply to the zone itself; chrome applies specifically to the contained part controls. Chrome includes verbs, borders, and other style attributes such as background color, or font style of the title text, for a zone's part controls. A zone determines the chrome details by using a single chrome object appropriate to the type of part controls it contains (e.g., a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPartChrome> object for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> that contains <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls). This single chrome object handles the chrome details and the rendering for all the part controls in the zone. This enables developers to create zones in which they can specify a consistent, common look and feel for all the part controls. Some properties that relate to the chrome for a zone's part controls include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartTitleStyle%2A> properties. Note that most chrome-related properties, including a specific property to reference the chrome object for a particular type of zone, are not implemented in the base WebZone class. Instead, most chrome-specific features of zones are implemented on specific zone types as appropriate to the unique needs of their part controls. See the topics for each zone type listed in the previous table of this topic.|   |Part Controls|The controls that reside in the body section of a zone. Every zone that inherits from the WebZone class contains in its body section one or more part controls of a corresponding type, as shown in the previous table in this topic. These part controls form the main UI of Web Parts applications. Most zone types that derive from WebZone have a collection property that enables them to reference all their contained part controls, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.WebParts%2A> property on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorParts%2A> property on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class.|   |Footer|The bottom section of a zone. Like the header section, it is not present in every type of zone, but usually occurs in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones. Typical contents of a footer section are verbs such as an ok verb or an apply verb, which appear in the footer of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zones. Some properties that relate to the footer section include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasFooter%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.FooterStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbStyle%2A> properties.|       Most of the WebZone class's properties are discussed in the preceding table that describes the common UI elements of zones. The WebZone class also has several methods relating to its role of rendering content. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderBody%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderContents%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderFooter%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderHeader%2A> methods can all be overridden to provide programmatic control over the rendering of each specific section of a zone. For example, if you want to customize the rendering of all the footer sections of catalog zones in your application, you could inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> class, override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderFooter%2A> method inherited from WebZone, and change the rendering of the footer section.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"extradata":"MT","nodes":[{"content":"A Web Parts zone is a defined region that contains server controls on a Web page, and provides a consistent user interface (UI), layout, and rendering for the contained controls.","pos":[0,178]},{"content":"Zones are rendered in a browser as HTML tables.","pos":[179,226]},{"content":"The WebZone class is the base class for all Web Parts zones.","pos":[233,293]},{"content":"A zone control is a composite control designed to contain other controls, hence the WebZone class inherits from the &lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControl&gt;

Zones are rendered in a browser as HTML tables.  \\n  \\n The WebZone class is the base class for all Web Parts zones. A zone control is a composite control designed to contain other controls, hence the WebZone class inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControl> class. Together with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> controls (or other user or server controls that can be placed in zones), zone controls derived from the WebZone base class form the essential building blocks of a Web Parts application.  \\n  \\n A critical role of Web Parts zones is to enable full Web Parts functionality for the controls they contain. Every Web Parts page contains at least one zone, and a zone can contain zero or more part controls. Zones are required for Web Parts functionality. Without zones, even controls that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class can have very little Web Parts functionality. Conversely, because of the design of the Web Parts control set, you can place ordinary ASP.NET controls, server controls, or user controls into a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone (which derives from WebZone), and by virtue of being in the zone, these ordinary server controls are enable to act as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls at run time. For details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is possible to add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls to a page outside of a zone, but in that case they simply function as ordinary server controls.  \\n  \\n There are two broad categories of zones in the Web Parts control set, all of which inherit from the base WebZone class.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones. These contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and other server and user) controls, and form the primary UI of Web Parts pages that users interact with most of the time.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones. These zones provide special views of a Web Parts page that enable users to modify (personalize) the content, layout, appearance, behavior, and properties of controls contained in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones on a Web Parts page. For example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> zone is a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> that provides a catalog view of a page, enabling users to add and remove server controls. An <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone is another type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> that provides an editing view of a page, enabling users to modify and edit the layout of the page, along with the properties, appearance, and behavior of the controls.  \\n  \\n Each zone in the Web Parts control set is designed to contain a corresponding type of control derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> class, with the part controls serving as the main content and primary UI of the zone. Zone types in the Web Parts control set, along with the corresponding types of part controls they contain, are shown in the following table.  \\n  \\n|Part control type|Zone type|  \\n|-----------------------|---------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and server and user controls, which are wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> at run time)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> )|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> (several derived controls are provided with the Web Parts control set, and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls can be developed)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> )|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> (several derived controls are provided with the Web Parts control set, and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls can be developed)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> )|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> (connection controls are unique in that they are not part controls that inherit from the base class)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> (inherits directly from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> )|  \\n  \\n All zones in the Web Parts control have basic, common user interface elements that they inherit from the base WebZone class. Not all these elements are visible on every zone, but each zone type is capable of having these common, zone-related UI elements, as described in the following table.  \\n  \\n|Zone section|Description|  \\n|------------------|-----------------|  \\n|Header|The top section of a zone. It includes header text, which can include a title for the zone; style attributes (such as a border or background color) that distinguish the header; and zone-level verbs (represented by buttons, hyperlinks, or images) that users can click to perform UI actions that apply to the entire zone, such as closing a zone. Several WebZone properties, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasHeader%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderStyle%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderText%2A>, relate to the header area of a zone. If there are zone-level verbs in the zone, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbStyle%2A> properties apply to them. Note that these two verb properties apply to zone-level verbs only, not to verbs in the individual part controls contained in the zone. Headers are not present in every type of zone; typically they appear in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones where there is a need to have a common header area with text and a verb, such as a close verb.|  \\n|Body|The main contents section of a zone. Every zone that derives from WebZone has a body section. For all types of zones in the Web Parts control set, the body of the zone contains the designated type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> controls (or other server controls) that correspond to a zone type, as indicated in the previous table. Various members of the WebZone class affect the contents of the body section, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.BackImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> properties. If the body section is empty, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A> message can be displayed in certain situations.|  \\n|Chrome|The common UI elements rendered for each part control in a zone. This is distinct from a discussion of style attributes that apply to the zone itself; chrome applies specifically to the contained part controls. Chrome includes verbs, borders, and other style attributes such as background color, or font style of the title text, for a zone's part controls. A zone determines the chrome details by using a single chrome object appropriate to the type of part controls it contains (e.g., a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPartChrome> object for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> that contains <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls). This single chrome object handles the chrome details and the rendering for all the part controls in the zone. This enables developers to create zones in which they can specify a consistent, common look and feel for all the part controls. Some properties that relate to the chrome for a zone's part controls include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartTitleStyle%2A> properties. Note that most chrome-related properties, including a specific property to reference the chrome object for a particular type of zone, are not implemented in the base WebZone class. Instead, most chrome-specific features of zones are implemented on specific zone types as appropriate to the unique needs of their part controls. See the topics for each zone type listed in the previous table of this topic.|  \\n|Part Controls|The controls that reside in the body section of a zone. Every zone that inherits from the WebZone class contains in its body section one or more part controls of a corresponding type, as shown in the previous table in this topic. These part controls form the main UI of Web Parts applications. Most zone types that derive from WebZone have a collection property that enables them to reference all their contained part controls, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.WebParts%2A> property on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorParts%2A> property on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class.|  \\n|Footer|The bottom section of a zone. Like the header section, it is not present in every type of zone, but usually occurs in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones. Typical contents of a footer section are verbs such as an ok verb or an apply verb, which appear in the footer of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zones. Some properties that relate to the footer section include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasFooter%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.FooterStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbStyle%2A> properties.|  \\n  \\n Most of the WebZone class's properties are discussed in the preceding table that describes the common UI elements of zones. The WebZone class also has several methods relating to its role of rendering content. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderBody%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderContents%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderFooter%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderHeader%2A> methods can all be overridden to provide programmatic control over the rendering of each specific section of a zone. For example, if you want to customize the rendering of all the footer sections of catalog zones in your application, you could inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> class, override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderFooter%2A> method inherited from WebZone, and change the rendering of the footer section.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebZone class.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example shows two custom controls that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_Zone_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_200_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_Zone_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_200_1.vb)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example shows a Web page that hosts the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Notice that the declarative markup contains two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> control and an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_Zone_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_200_2.aspx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_Zone_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_200_2.aspx)]  \\n  \\n You can load the page in a browser and switch among the various page display modes to see how the different zones behave.
