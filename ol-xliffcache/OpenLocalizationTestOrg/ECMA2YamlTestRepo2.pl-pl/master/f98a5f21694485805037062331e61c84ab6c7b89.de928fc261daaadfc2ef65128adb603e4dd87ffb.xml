Each of these techniques requires that you first create a new property metadata object (<xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata>, or a derived class such as <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkPropertyMetadata>). Create the metadata object using a constructor signature that takes the `coerceValueCallback` parameter, and assign that parameter to your callback handler. Or construct the metadata by any signature and set the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.CoerceValueCallback%2A> property prior to putting the metadata in use.       When you have this metadata, you can:      -   Define a new dependency property on a new class, using either signature of  <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A>, giving the metadata as the `typeMetadata` value.      -   Override the metadata (call <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.OverrideMetadata%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.PropertyMetadata%29>) for an existing dependency property, when you derive from the class that owns the dependency property.      -   Add an existing dependency property to a new <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> class, using new metadata, by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.PropertyMetadata%29>.
