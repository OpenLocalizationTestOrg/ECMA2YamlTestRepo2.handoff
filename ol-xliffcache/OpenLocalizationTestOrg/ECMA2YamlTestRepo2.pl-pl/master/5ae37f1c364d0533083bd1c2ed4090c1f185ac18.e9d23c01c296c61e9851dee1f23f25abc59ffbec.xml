The code example has three parts:  \\n  \\n-   Source code for two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can form a connection using the IWebPartTable interface, with one control acting as the provider and the other acting as the consumer.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that hosts the controls and declares the static connection in persistence format.  \\n  \\n-   A description of what happens when the example code runs.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is the source code for the two custom controls. First is the code for the provider, which implements the IWebPartTable interface. For simplicity in the example, the provider creates a table with some data rather than connecting to a database. The `GetConnectionInterface` method serves as the provider's connection point, the callback method that returns the interface instance to the consumer. As for the consumer, it retrieves the interface instance from the provider in its method named `SetConnectionInterface`, which is marked with a `ConnectionConsumer` attribute. After retrieving the instance of the interface, the consumer, in its `OnPreRender` method, calls the implementation of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPartTable.GetTableData%2A> method in the provider, to retrieve the actual data and write it to the page.  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses dynamic compilation. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_IWebPartTable_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_208_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebPartTable_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_208_1.vb)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example is the Web page that declares the static connection and hosts the controls. Near the top of the page is a `Register` directive that declares the namespace of the source code contained in the App_Code directory. The connection is declared using an `<asp:webpartconnection>` element. The custom consumer and provider controls are declared in a `<zonetemplate>` element within an `<asp:webpartzone>` element, which is required for them to be able to connect (they must reside within a zone that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class).  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebPartRow_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_208_2.aspx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_IWebPartRow_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_208_2.aspx)]  \\n  \\n Load the page in a browser.
