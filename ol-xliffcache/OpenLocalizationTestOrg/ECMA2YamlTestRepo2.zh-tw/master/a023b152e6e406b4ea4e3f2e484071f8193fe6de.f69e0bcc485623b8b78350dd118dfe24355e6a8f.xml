The Form class can be used to create standard, tool, borderless, and floating windows. You can also use the Form class to create modal windows such as a dialog box. A special kind of form, the multiple-document interface (MDI) form, can contain other forms called MDI child forms. An MDI form is created by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.IsMdiContainer%2A> property to `true`. MDI child forms are created by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MdiParent%2A> property to the MDI parent form that will contain the child form.       Using the properties available in the Form class, you can determine the appearance, size, color, and window management features of the window or dialog box you are creating. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property allows you to specify the caption of the window in the title bar. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.DesktopLocation%2A> properties allow you to define the size and position of the window when it is displayed. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ForeColor%2A> color property to change the default foreground color of all controls placed on the form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MinimizeBox%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MaximizeBox%2A> properties allow you to control whether the form can be minimized, maximized, or resized at run time.       In addition to properties, you can use the methods of the class to manipulate a form. For example, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A> method to show a form as a modal dialog box. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.SetDesktopLocation%2A> method to position the form on the desktop.       The events of the Form class allow you to respond to actions performed on the form. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Activated> event to perform operations such as updating the data displayed in the controls of the form when the form is activated.       You can use a form as the starting class in your application by placing a method called `Main` in the class. In the `Main` method add code to create and show the form. You will also need to add the `STAThread` attribute to the `Main` method in order for the form to run. When the starting form is closed, the application is also closed.       If you set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled%2A> property to `false` before the Form is visible (for example, setting <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled%2A> to false in the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)] designer), the minimize, maximize, close, and system buttons remain enabled.

You can override the value assigned to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.DialogResult%2A> property when the user clicks the **Close** button by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.DialogResult%2A> property in an event handler for the Closing event of the form.      > [!NOTE] >  When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Close%2A> method is called on a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> displayed as a modeless window, you cannot call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Show%2A> method to make the form visible, because the form's resources have already been released. To hide a form and then make it visible, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Hide%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.      > [!CAUTION] >  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Closed?displayProperty=fullName> and Closing events are not raised when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.Exit%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called to exit your application. If you have validation code in either of these events that must be executed, you should call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Close%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method for each open form individually before calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.Exit%2A> method.       If the form is an MDI parent form, the Closing events of all MDI child forms are raised before the MDI parent form's Closing event is raised. In addition, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Closed> events of all MDI child forms are raised before the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Closed> event of the MDI parent form is raised. Canceling the Closing event of an MDI child form does not prevent the Closing event of the MDI parent form from being raised. However, canceling the event will set to `true` the <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs.Cancel%2A> property of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs> that is passed as a parameter to the parent form. To force all MDI parent and child forms to close, set the <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs.Cancel%2A> property to `false` in the MDI parent form.

If the form is displayed as a dialog box, setting this property with a value from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult> enumeration sets the value of the dialog box result for the form, hides the modal dialog box, and returns control to the calling form. This property is typically set by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.DialogResult%2A> property of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control on the form.

The Form class can be used to create standard, tool, borderless, and floating windows. You can also use the Form class to create modal windows such as a dialog box. A special kind of form, the multiple-document interface (MDI) form, can contain other forms called MDI child forms. An MDI form is created by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.IsMdiContainer%2A> property to `true`. MDI child forms are created by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MdiParent%2A> property to the MDI parent form that will contain the child form.  \\n  \\n Using the properties available in the Form class, you can determine the appearance, size, color, and window management features of the window or dialog box you are creating. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property allows you to specify the caption of the window in the title bar. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.DesktopLocation%2A> properties allow you to define the size and position of the window when it is displayed. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ForeColor%2A> color property to change the default foreground color of all controls placed on the form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MinimizeBox%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MaximizeBox%2A> properties allow you to control whether the form can be minimized, maximized, or resized at run time.  \\n  \\n In addition to properties, you can use the methods of the class to manipulate a form. For example, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A> method to show a form as a modal dialog box. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.SetDesktopLocation%2A> method to position the form on the desktop.  \\n  \\n The events of the Form class allow you to respond to actions performed on the form. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Activated> event to perform operations such as updating the data displayed in the controls of the form when the form is activated.  \\n  \\n You can use a form as the starting class in your application by placing a method called `Main` in the class. In the `Main` method add code to create and show the form. You will also need to add the `STAThread` attribute to the `Main` method in order for the form to run. When the starting form is closed, the application is also closed.  \\n  \\n If you set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled%2A> property to `false` before the Form is visible (for example, setting <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled%2A> to false in the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)] designer), the minimize, maximize, close, and system buttons remain enabled. If you set <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled%2A> to `false` after the Form is visible (for example, when the Load event occurs), the buttons are disabled.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example creates a new instance of a Form and calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A> method to display the form as a dialog box. The example sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.AcceptButton%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.CancelButton%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MinimizeBox%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.MaximizeBox%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.StartPosition%2A> properties to change the appearance and functionality of the form to a dialog box. The example also uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ControlCollection.Add%2A> method of the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> collection to add two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls. The example uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.HelpButton%2A> property to display a help button in the caption bar of the dialog box.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic Form.AcceptButton Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.f_4_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-cs[Classic Form.AcceptButton Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.f_4_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic Form.AcceptButton Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.f_4_1.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.DefaultEvent(\"Load\")]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.Designer(\"System.Windows.Forms.Design.FormDocumentDesigner, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\", typeof(System.ComponentModel.Design.IRootDesigner))]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategory(\"Form\")]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.DesignTimeVisible(false)]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.InitializationEvent(\"Load\")]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItem(false)]\n\n      [System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItemFilter(\"System.Windows.Forms.Control.TopLevel\")]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterface(System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceType.AutoDispatch)]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public class Form : System.Windows.Forms.ContainerControl\n  inheritance:\n  -
