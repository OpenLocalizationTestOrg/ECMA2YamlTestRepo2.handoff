Frame can be hosted within other content, as with other controls and elements.      > [!CAUTION] >  When the Frame control navigates to HTML content, the Frame control internally instantiates the native WebBrowser ActiveX control. WPF enables security features by applying feature controls to the WebBrowser ActiveX control. The feature controls that are applied differ for XBAPs and stand-alone applications. Some applications should apply additional feature controls to prevent malicious content from running. For more information, see the \"WebBrowser Control and Feature Controls\" section in [Security (WPF)](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) and [WebBrowser Control Overviews and Tutorials](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179388).       Content can be any type of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] object and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_html](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-html-md.md)] files. In general, however, pages are the preferred the way to package content for navigation (see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>).       Content can be navigated to by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Source%2A> property with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for the desired content. Additionally, content can be navigated to by using one of the following overloads of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%2A> method:      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Uri%29>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%29>       When content is navigated to by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], Frame returns an object that contains the content. Alternatively, content can be navigated to by using one of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%2A> method overloads that accepts an object:      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Object%29>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%29>       The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigating>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigated>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationProgress>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationFailed>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationStopped>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.LoadCompleted>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.FragmentNavigation>       Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).       The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events will fire:       ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \"Page navigation flow chart\")       During or after a navigation, Frame provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.Content%2A>).       When content is navigated to, Frame records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively.       The first time that one piece of content is navigated to from another piece of content, Frame automatically displays a navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] that allows users to navigate back and forward through navigation history. You can configure when the navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] is shown by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationUIVisibility%2A> property.       By default, Frame will use its own navigation history only if a parent navigator (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, Frame) with its own navigation history cannot be found. This means that navigation history entries for the frame are mingled with navigation history entries for the parent navigator. To specify that a Frame manages its own navigation history, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.JournalOwnership%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.JournalOwnership>.       The most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.       Frame does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, Frame creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a state for a piece of content in navigation history.       Using <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.      ## Customizing the Frame Control    To apply the same property settings to multiple Frame controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the Frame, see [Frame Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).      > [!NOTE] >  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in Frame control's default template and is set by using a .

Frame can be hosted within other content, as with other controls and elements.  \\n  \\n> [!CAUTION]\\n>  When the Frame control navigates to HTML content, the Frame control internally instantiates the native WebBrowser ActiveX control. WPF enables security features by applying feature controls to the WebBrowser ActiveX control. The feature controls that are applied differ for XBAPs and stand-alone applications. Some applications should apply additional feature controls to prevent malicious content from running. For more information, see the \\\"WebBrowser Control and Feature Controls\\\" section in [Security (WPF)](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) and [WebBrowser Control Overviews and Tutorials](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179388).  \\n  \\n Content can be any type of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] object and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_html](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-html-md.md)] files. In general, however, pages are the preferred the way to package content for navigation (see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>).  \\n  \\n Content can be navigated to by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Source%2A> property with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for the desired content. Additionally, content can be navigated to by using one of the following overloads of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%2A> method:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Uri%29>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%29>  \\n  \\n When content is navigated to by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], Frame returns an object that contains the content. Alternatively, content can be navigated to by using one of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%2A> method overloads that accepts an object:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Object%29>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%29>  \\n  \\n The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigating>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigated>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationProgress>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationFailed>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationStopped>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.LoadCompleted>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.FragmentNavigation>  \\n  \\n Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).  \\n  \\n The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events will fire:  \\n  \\n ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \\\"Page navigation flow chart\\\")  \\n  \\n During or after a navigation, Frame provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.Content%2A>).  \\n  \\n When content is navigated to, Frame records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively.  \\n  \\n The first time that one piece of content is navigated to from another piece of content, Frame automatically displays a navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] that allows users to navigate back and forward through navigation history. You can configure when the navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] is shown by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationUIVisibility%2A> property.  \\n  \\n By default, Frame will use its own navigation history only if a parent navigator (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, Frame) with its own navigation history cannot be found. This means that navigation history entries for the frame are mingled with navigation history entries for the parent navigator. To specify that a Frame manages its own navigation history, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.JournalOwnership%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.JournalOwnership>.  \\n  \\n The most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.  \\n  \\n Frame does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, Frame creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a state for a piece of content in navigation history.  \\n  \\n Using <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.  \\n  \\n## Customizing the Frame Control  \\n To apply the same property settings to multiple Frame controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the Frame, see [Frame Styles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in Frame control's default template and is set by using a . You can find a list of visual properties in the \\\"Changing the Visual Structure of a Control\\\" section in [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](../Topic/Customizing%20the%20Appearance%20of%20an%20Existing%20Control%20by%20Creating%20a%20ControlTemplate.md).\"\n  example:\n  -
