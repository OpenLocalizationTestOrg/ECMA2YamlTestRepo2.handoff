The first part of the code example shows how the interface is implemented in a user control. The user control implements the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebActionable.Verbs%2A> property by creating two custom verbs and defining a method that is called when a user clicks either of the verbs. For simplicity, the same method is used for both verbs. The method updates the value of a property named `VerbCounterClicks`. The code for the `Page_Load` method accesses the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Verbs%2A> property of the control to display the total count of custom verbs in the collection. This count does not include the standard Web Parts verbs.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This example has a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat.
