ServiceBase must be derived from when creating a new service class.\n  remarks: \"Derive from ServiceBase when defining your service class in a service application. Any useful service overrides the [OnStart(String\\\\[\\\\])](assetId:///M:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart(System.String[])?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A> methods. For additional functionality, you can override <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnPause%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnContinue%2A> with specific behavior in response to changes in the service state.  \\n  \\n A service is a long-running executable that does not support a user interface, and which might not run under the logged-on user account. The service can run without any user being logged on to the computer.  \\n  \\n By default, services run under the System account, which is not the same as the Administrator account. You cannot change the rights of the System account. Alternatively, you can use a <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> to specify a user account under which the service will run.  \\n  \\n An executable can contain more than one service but must contain a separate <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> for each service. The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> instance registers the service with the system. The installer also associates each service with an event log that you can use to record service commands. The `main()` function in the executable defines which services should run. The current working directory of the service is the system directory, not the directory in which the executable is located.  \\n  \\n When you start a service, the system locates the executable and runs the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method for that service, contained within the executable. However, running the service is not the same as running the executable. The executable only loads the service. The service is accessed (for example, started and stopped) through the Service Control Manager.  \\n  \\n The executable calls the ServiceBase derived class's constructor the first time you call Start on the service. The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> command-handling method is called immediately after the constructor executes. The constructor is not executed again after the first time the service has been loaded, so it is necessary to separate the processing performed by the constructor from that performed by <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A>. Any resources that can be released by <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A> should be created in <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A>. Creating resources in the constructor prevents them from being created properly if the service is started again after <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A> has released the resources.  \\n  \\n The Service Control Manager (SCM) provides a way to interact with the service. You can use the SCM to pass Start, Stop, Pause, Continue, or custom commands into the service. The SCM uses the values of <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanStop%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> to determine whether the service accepts Stop, Pause, or Continue commands. Stop, Pause, and Continue are enabled in the SCM's context menus only if the corresponding property <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanStop%2A> or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> is `true` in the service class. If enabled, the command is passed to the service, and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnPause%2A>, or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnContinue%2A> is called. If <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanStop%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanShutdown%2A>, or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> is `false`, the corresponding command-handling method (such as <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A>) will not be processed, even if you have implemented the method.  \\n  \\n You can use the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController> class to do programmatically what the SCM does using a user interface. You can automate the tasks available in the console.
