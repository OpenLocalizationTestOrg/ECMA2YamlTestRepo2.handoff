Parts personalization. This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"This class provides several static methods and properties that expose management and administrative functionality for Web Parts personalization. These methods apply to the default personalization provider configured in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control for a Web Parts control. If you need to administer several data stores that are acting as personalization providers, you should use the methods on the individual personalization provider classes directly. Note that the collection of configured personalization providers for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control is available from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationAdministration.Providers%2A> static property.  \\n  \\n It is important to be aware that personalization will fail if your Web application does not run at the default trust level of <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel> or higher (you can set custom trust levels in a Web.config file using the `<trust level=\\\"\\\" />` element). The PersonalizationAdministration and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.SqlPersonalizationProvider> classes both check for a trust level of <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel> when they are initialized. If you configure your application to run at a trust level of <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel>, and you use the default <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.SqlPersonalizationProvider> provider to manage the personalization data for your application, the first time that the application tries to access personalization data, it will fail because an ASP.NET worker process running in <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel> trust does not have the permissions necessary to call into the various classes in the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient> namespace.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use several methods in the PersonalizationAdministration class. This example consists of an .aspx page that references a Web Parts user control named `Persadmin.ascx`.
