This structure can be used to represent various types of information including identity, entitlement, and holder attributes (permissions, age, sex, location, affiliation, and so forth). Although the ISO specifications are most informative on the structure itself, the X509Certificate2 class is designed to model the usage scenarios defined in specifications issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Public Key Infrastructure, X.509 (PKIX) working group. The most informative of these specifications is RFC 3280, \\\"[Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=45286).\\\"  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/add/includes/net-v46-md.md)], this type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n>   \\n>  For apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v452](~/add/includes/net-v452-md.md)] and earlier versions, the X509Certificate2 class does not implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface and therefore does not have a `Dispose` method.\"\n  example:\n  -
