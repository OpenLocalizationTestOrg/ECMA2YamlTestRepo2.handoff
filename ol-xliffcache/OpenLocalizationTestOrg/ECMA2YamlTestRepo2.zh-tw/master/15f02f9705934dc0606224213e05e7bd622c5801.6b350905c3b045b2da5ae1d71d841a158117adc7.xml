For example, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A> value is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContextMode> the result is that your service can only process one message at a time unless you also set the ConcurrencyMode value to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>. This property also produces behavior in combination with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. For details, see [Sessions, Instancing, and Concurrency](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> instructs the system to restrict instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, which frees you from dealing with threading issues. A value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> means that service objects can be executed by multiple threads at any one time. In this case, you must ensure thread safety.       <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> also restricts access to a single thread at a time; while the operation is processing, no other message can enter the operation. If during the operation a call to another service leaves, the current message loses the lock on the operation, which is free to process other messages. When the service call out returns, the lock is reestablished and the original message can continue processing to its conclusion or until another call out of the operation occurs.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  Even though <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> restricts instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, you must also set <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentCalls%2A> to 1 to guarantee no out-of-order messages.   >    >  Also, it is your responsibility to leave your object state consistent before callouts and you must confirm that operation-local data is valid after callouts. Note that the service instance is unlocked only by calling another service over a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] channel. In this case, the called service can reenter the first service via a callback. If the first service is not reentrant, the sequence of calls results in a deadlock. For details, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>.       During any outbound call from a processing operation, data not local to the operation can be modified. (Local state data is guaranteed to be valid when the original message resumes processing.) As a result, before your outbound call you must ensure that non-local data is valid for other incoming calls and revalidate non-local data after the outbound call returns.       The following pseudo-code illustrates the required pattern for successful reentrant support.      ```c#   public void MyMethod()   {     this.SomeNonLocalDataState;     // Here you need to clean nonlocal state for other users     OutboundProxy proxy = new OutboundProxy();     int returnValue = proxy.CallOutOfOperation();     // Ensure that this.SomeNonLocalDataState is valid for continued use.     this.ModifyNonLocalState;     return returnValue;   }      ```       Using the Begin/End asynchronous call pattern for an outbound call when the ConcurrencyMode is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> triggers an exception. Asynchronous outbound calls require an operation in which ConcurrencyMode is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>, in which case you must handle synchronization issues.       Generally, if a message arrives for an instance that violates its concurrency mode, the message waits until the instance is available, or until it times out.       In addition, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> and a reentrant call is blocked while waiting for the instance to be freed, the system detects the deadlock and throws an exception.      > [!NOTE] >  A <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown at runtime if <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> is `true` when the ConcurrencyMode property is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>.       Note that you must explicitly set <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> to `false` if there is an operation with <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A?displayProperty=fullName> set to true and you set ConcurrencyMode to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>.

For example, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A> value is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContextMode> the result is that your service can only process one message at a time unless you also set the ConcurrencyMode value to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>. This property also produces behavior in combination with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. For details, see [Sessions, Instancing, and Concurrency](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> instructs the system to restrict instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, which frees you from dealing with threading issues. A value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> means that service objects can be executed by multiple threads at any one time. In this case, you must ensure thread safety.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> also restricts access to a single thread at a time; while the operation is processing, no other message can enter the operation. If during the operation a call to another service leaves, the current message loses the lock on the operation, which is free to process other messages. When the service call out returns, the lock is reestablished and the original message can continue processing to its conclusion or until another call out of the operation occurs.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Even though <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> restricts instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, you must also set <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentCalls%2A> to 1 to guarantee no out-of-order messages.  \\n>   \\n>  Also, it is your responsibility to leave your object state consistent before callouts and you must confirm that operation-local data is valid after callouts. Note that the service instance is unlocked only by calling another service over a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] channel. In this case, the called service can reenter the first service via a callback. If the first service is not reentrant, the sequence of calls results in a deadlock. For details, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>.  \\n  \\n During any outbound call from a processing operation, data not local to the operation can be modified. (Local state data is guaranteed to be valid when the original message resumes processing.) As a result, before your outbound call you must ensure that non-local data is valid for other incoming calls and revalidate non-local data after the outbound call returns.  \\n  \\n The following pseudo-code illustrates the required pattern for successful reentrant support.  \\n  \\n```c#  \\npublic void MyMethod()  \\n{  \\n  this.SomeNonLocalDataState;  \\n  // Here you need to clean nonlocal state for other users  \\n  OutboundProxy proxy = new OutboundProxy();  \\n  int returnValue = proxy.CallOutOfOperation();  \\n  // Ensure that this.SomeNonLocalDataState is valid for continued use.  \\n  this.ModifyNonLocalState;  \\n  return returnValue;  \\n}  \\n  \\n```  \\n  \\n Using the Begin/End asynchronous call pattern for an outbound call when the ConcurrencyMode is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> triggers an exception. Asynchronous outbound calls require an operation in which ConcurrencyMode is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>, in which case you must handle synchronization issues.  \\n  \\n Generally, if a message arrives for an instance that violates its concurrency mode, the message waits until the instance is available, or until it times out.  \\n  \\n In addition, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> and a reentrant call is blocked while waiting for the instance to be freed, the system detects the deadlock and throws an exception.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  A <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown at runtime if <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> is `true` when the ConcurrencyMode property is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>.  \\n  \\n Note that you must explicitly set <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> to `false` if there is an operation with <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A?displayProperty=fullName> set to true and you set ConcurrencyMode to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>. Otherwise a validation exception is thrown because the default value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> is `true`.  \\n  \\n There is an interaction of the ConcurrencyMode and other properties that can alter runtime behavior.

Because [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] applications execute under both types of error systems, any managed exception information that needs to be sent to the client must be converted from exceptions into SOAP faults. For more information, see [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n During development, you may want your service to also send other exceptions back to the client to assist you in debugging. This is a development-only feature and should not be employed in deployed services.  \\n  \\n To facilitate debugging development, set the IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults to `true` either in code or using an application configuration file.  \\n  \\n When enabled, the service automatically returns safer exception information to the caller. These faults appear to the client as <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultException%601> objects of type <xref:System.ServiceModel.ExceptionDetail>.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Setting IncludeExceptionDetailInFaultsto `true` enables clients to obtain information about internal service method exceptions; it is only recommended as a way of temporarily debugging a service application. In addition, the WSDL for a method that returns unhandled managed exceptions in this way does not contain the contract for the <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultException%601> of type <xref:System.ServiceModel.ExceptionDetail>. Clients must expect the possibility of an unknown SOAP fault to obtain the debugging information properly.  \\n  \\n Setting this property to `true` can also be done using an application configuration file and the [\\\\&lt;serviceDebug\\\\&gt;](../Topic/%3CserviceDebug%3E.md) element, as the following code example shows.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[XpsCreate#XpsCreateAddPkgContent](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/XpsCreate/XpsCreate.cs#xpscreateaddpkgcontent)]\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> properties.
