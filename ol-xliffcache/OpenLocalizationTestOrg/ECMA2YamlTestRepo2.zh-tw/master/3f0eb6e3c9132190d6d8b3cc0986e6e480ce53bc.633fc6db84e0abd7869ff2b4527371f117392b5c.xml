The core of this design is CryptoStream. Any cryptographic objects that implement CryptoStream can be chained together with any objects that implement <xref:System.IO.Stream>, so the streamed output from one object can be fed into the input of another object. The intermediate result (the output from the first object) does not need to be stored separately.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly by calling its <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream.Clear%2A> method, which in turn calls its <xref:System.IDisposable> implementation. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream.Clear%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n  \\n You should always explicitly close your CryptoStream object after you are done using it by calling the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream.Clear%2A> method.  Doing so flushes the underlying stream and causes all remaining blocks of data to be processed by the CryptoStream object.  However, if an exception occurs before you call the <xref:System.IO.Stream.Close%2A> method, the CryptoStream object might not be closed.  To ensure that the <xref:System.IO.Stream.Close%2A> method always gets called, place your call to the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream.Clear%2A> method within the `finally` block of a `try`/`catch` statement.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates how to use a CryptoStream to encrypt a string.
