The example code uses coordinates located in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs> object passed as a parameter to the event handler to determine the location in the control to obtain the character. The character is then displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> if it is not a space character. This example assumes that a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox> control named `richTextBox1` has been created and that the example code is connected to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox>.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[RichTextBox.GetCharAtIndex#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.m_15_1.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[RichTextBox.GetCharAtIndex#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.m_15_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cpp[RichTextBox.GetCharAtIndex#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.m_15_1.cpp)]  \\n  \\n The following example demonstrates using different mouse events to draw the path of the mouse on a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>. A line segment is added to the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> for each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseMove> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> events that occur. To update the graphics, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A> method is called for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> on each `MouseDown` and `MouseUp` event. In addition, the graphic path is scrolled up or down when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseWheel> event occurs. Additional mouse events, like <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseHover>, are identified on screen as well. Also displayed on the screen is additional information about the mouse from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.MouseEvent#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.m_15_2.cpp)]\\n [!code-cs[System.Windows.Forms.MouseEvent#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.m_15_2.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.MouseEvent#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.m_15_2.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Flags]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public enum MouseButtons\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Left\n  id: Left\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Left\n  nameWithType: MouseButtons.Left\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Left\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The left mouse button was pressed.\n  syntax:\n    content: Left\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Middle\n  id: Middle\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Middle\n  nameWithType: MouseButtons.Middle\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Middle\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The middle mouse button was pressed.\n  syntax:\n    content: Middle\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.None\n  id: None\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: None\n  nameWithType: MouseButtons.None\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.None\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: No mouse button was pressed.\n  syntax:\n    content: None\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Right\n  id: Right\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Right\n  nameWithType: MouseButtons.Right\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Right\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The right mouse button was pressed.\n  syntax:\n    content: Right\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.XButton1\n  id: XButton1\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: XButton1\n  nameWithType: MouseButtons.XButton1\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.XButton1\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: The first XButton was pressed.\n  remarks: With Windows 2000, Microsoft is introducing support for the Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer, which is a mouse with five buttons.
