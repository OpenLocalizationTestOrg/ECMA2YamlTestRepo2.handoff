Tool-oriented part controls in the Web Parts control set have two distinguishing characteristics:      -   They are helper controls that enable end users to personalize controls on a Web Parts page.      -   They are visible only in certain display modes.       DeclarativeCatalogPart is a part control that must reside in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> type of zone, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> zone provided with the Web Parts control set. The DeclarativeCatalogPart control becomes visible only when a Web page is in catalog display mode.       The DeclarativeCatalogPart control provides a way for developers to add a set of server controls declaratively to a catalog on a Web page. A catalog, in the Web Parts control set, is simply a list of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server controls that is visible when a page is in catalog display mode. A user can select controls from the list and add them to the Web page, which effectively gives users the ability to change the set of controls and the functionality on a page.      > [!NOTE] >  Users can add multiple instances of the same control in a catalog to a Web page.       An advantage of using a DeclarativeCatalogPart control to create a catalog of server controls is that it does not require any coding. Page developers can work with the control entirely in the declarative (or page persistence) format, hence the name of the control.       The DeclarativeCatalogPart control has a useful property that allows developers to set up a catalog of controls that can be used throughout an entire site. Rather than declare individual server controls within a DeclarativeCatalogPart control, a developer can set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart.WebPartsListUserControlPath%2A> property value to the path of a user control that contains the list of server controls that should be in the catalog. At run time, the server controls referenced in the user control are loaded in the catalog. In this way, multiple pages or sites could reference the same user control to create a catalog. When the user control's list of server controls is updated, it would update all catalogs based on the user control.       The DeclarativeCatalogPart class has a number of public properties that override the inherited properties. Most of these properties are not actually used for rendering the control; they are overridden only so that special code attributes can be set on them to hide them from design tools like [!INCLUDE[vsprvsext](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]. You should not use these hidden properties, as they have no effect on rendering. The fact that they are hidden from IntelliSense and the Properties pane in Visual Studio helps developers avoid using them by mistake. All these hidden properties are noted as such in their respective Help topics.       The DeclarativeCatalogPart class also has several methods. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart.GetAvailableWebPartDescriptions%2A> method retrieves a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDescription> object for each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control in the catalog, which enables a DeclarativeCatalogPart control to display information about each server control without having to create an instance of it. Another method is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart.GetWebPart%2A> method. This method gets an instance of a particular <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, based on the description passed to the method.      > [!NOTE] >  To improve accessibility, the DeclarativeCatalogPart control is rendered within a `<fieldset>` element.

This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"Just as there are tool-oriented zones in the Web Parts control set (for details, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class overview), there are tool-oriented <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> controls, and each of these controls must reside in a certain type of tool zone. Tool-oriented part controls in the Web Parts control set have two distinguishing characteristics:  \\n  \\n-   They are helper controls that enable end users to personalize controls on a Web Parts page.  \\n  \\n-   They are visible only in certain display modes.  \\n  \\n DeclarativeCatalogPart is a part control that must reside in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> type of zone, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> zone provided with the Web Parts control set. The DeclarativeCatalogPart control becomes visible only when a Web page is in catalog display mode.  \\n  \\n The DeclarativeCatalogPart control provides a way for developers to add a set of server controls declaratively to a catalog on a Web page. A catalog, in the Web Parts control set, is simply a list of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server controls that is visible when a page is in catalog display mode. A user can select controls from the list and add them to the Web page, which effectively gives users the ability to change the set of controls and the functionality on a page.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Users can add multiple instances of the same control in a catalog to a Web page.  \\n  \\n An advantage of using a DeclarativeCatalogPart control to create a catalog of server controls is that it does not require any coding. Page developers can work with the control entirely in the declarative (or page persistence) format, hence the name of the control.  \\n  \\n The DeclarativeCatalogPart control has a useful property that allows developers to set up a catalog of controls that can be used throughout an entire site. Rather than declare individual server controls within a DeclarativeCatalogPart control, a developer can set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart.WebPartsListUserControlPath%2A> property value to the path of a user control that contains the list of server controls that should be in the catalog. At run time, the server controls referenced in the user control are loaded in the catalog. In this way, multiple pages or sites could reference the same user control to create a catalog. When the user control's list of server controls is updated, it would update all catalogs based on the user control.  \\n  \\n The DeclarativeCatalogPart class has a number of public properties that override the inherited properties. Most of these properties are not actually used for rendering the control; they are overridden only so that special code attributes can be set on them to hide them from design tools like [!INCLUDE[vsprvsext](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]. You should not use these hidden properties, as they have no effect on rendering. The fact that they are hidden from IntelliSense and the Properties pane in Visual Studio helps developers avoid using them by mistake. All these hidden properties are noted as such in their respective Help topics.  \\n  \\n The DeclarativeCatalogPart class also has several methods. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart.GetAvailableWebPartDescriptions%2A> method retrieves a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDescription> object for each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control in the catalog, which enables a DeclarativeCatalogPart control to display information about each server control without having to create an instance of it. Another method is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart.GetWebPart%2A> method. This method gets an instance of a particular <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, based on the description passed to the method.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To improve accessibility, the DeclarativeCatalogPart control is rendered within a `<fieldset>` element. The `<fieldset>` element groups the related set of controls used for editing in the DeclarativeCatalogPart control, and it facilitates tabbed navigation among those controls for both visual user agents (such as ordinary Web browsers) and speech-oriented user agents (such as screen-reading software).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use the DeclarativeCatalogPart control declaratively on a Web page. The example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that contains a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> control and a DeclarativeCatalogPart control.  \\n  \\n-   A source code file that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works when you load the page in a browser.  \\n  \\n The first part of this code example is the user control that enables you to change display modes on the page. For details about display modes and a description of the source code in this control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_DeclarativeCatalogPart_Overview#7](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_119_1.ascx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_DeclarativeCatalogPart_Overview#7](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_119_1.ascx)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example is the Web page. At the top of the page are two `Register` directives, one for the user control and one for the compiled component that contains the two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Notice that the page has a declarative reference to the DeclarativeCatalogPart control, nested within the proper hierarchy of declarative elements as described in the Remarks section of this topic. The `<asp:declarativecatalogpart>` element contains a `<webpartstemplate>` element, which in turn contains references for a standard ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control and the two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls; these are the controls that users can select from the catalog. The page also contains editing capability, with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PropertyGridEditorPart> control declared on the page. This control enables users to edit certain properties on the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls after they have been added to the page, and after the user has switched the page to edit mode.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_DeclarativeCatalogPart_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_119_2.aspx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_DeclarativeCatalogPart_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_119_2.aspx)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is the source code for the two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Notice that some properties on these controls are marked with the `WebBrowsable` attribute. This enables the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PropertyGridEditorPart> control to dynamically generate the user interface (UI) for a user to edit those properties when the controls are in edit mode. The properties are also marked with a `WebDisplayName` attribute, to specify the text of the label that appears next to each control in the editing UI.  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_DeclarativeCatalogPart_Overview#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_119_3.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_DeclarativeCatalogPart_Overview#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_119_3.vb)]  \\n  \\n When you load the page in a browser, select **Catalog Mode** in the **Display Mode** drop-down list control to switch to catalog mode. In catalog mode, you can see the controls that are available to be added to the page. Add all three controls, and then use the **Display Mode** drop-down list to return the page to browse mode. The three controls appear on the page. If you use the **Display Mode** drop-down list and switch the page to edit mode, you can click the verbs menu (the downward arrow) in the title bar of the **User Information WebPart** control, and click **Edit** to edit the control. When the editing UI is visible, you can see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PropertyGridEditorPart> control. Notice that a control is rendered for each of the properties of the `UserInfoWebPart` class that was marked with the `WebBrowsable` attribute. If you make some changes in the editing UI and click the **Apply** button, you can use the **Display Mode** drop-down list to return the page to browse mode and see the full effect of the editing changes.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.Designer(\"System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPartDesigner, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\")]\n\n      public sealed class DeclarativeCatalogPart : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart\n  inheritance:\n  -
