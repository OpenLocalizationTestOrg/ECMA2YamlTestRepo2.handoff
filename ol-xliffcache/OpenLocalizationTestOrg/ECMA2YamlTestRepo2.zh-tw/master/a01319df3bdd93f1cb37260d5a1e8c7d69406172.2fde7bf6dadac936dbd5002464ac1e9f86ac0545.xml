The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationStopped>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation>.       Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).       The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events are raised:       ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \"Page navigation flow chart\")       During or after a navigation, NavigationService provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Content%2A>).       When content is navigated to, NavigationService records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively. Also, the most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.       By default, NavigationService does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, NavigationService creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a piece of state for a piece of content in navigation history.       Using <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.       NavigationService is `sealed` class and, therefore, cannot be instantiated; instead, NavigationService is used by navigators to enable navigation. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)], there are two navigators: <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>.

In general, however, pages are the preferred as the way to package content for navigation (see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>).  \\n  \\n Content can be navigated to by providing an instance of an object and calling an overload of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method that accepts an object:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n Alternatively, content can be navigated to by passing a relative or absolute [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] to one of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method overloads that accepts a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)]:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n When content is navigated to by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], NavigationService will return an object that contains the content.  \\n  \\n The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationStopped>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation>.  \\n  \\n Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).  \\n  \\n The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events are raised:  \\n  \\n ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \\\"Page navigation flow chart\\\")  \\n  \\n During or after a navigation, NavigationService provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Content%2A>).  \\n  \\n When content is navigated to, NavigationService records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively. Also, the most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.  \\n  \\n By default, NavigationService does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, NavigationService creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a piece of state for a piece of content in navigation history.  \\n  \\n Using <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.  \\n  \\n NavigationService is `sealed` class and, therefore, cannot be instantiated; instead, NavigationService is used by navigators to enable navigation. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)], there are two navigators: <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>.  \\n  \\n Visually, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] use [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] as a navigator, to provide an integrated user experience.
