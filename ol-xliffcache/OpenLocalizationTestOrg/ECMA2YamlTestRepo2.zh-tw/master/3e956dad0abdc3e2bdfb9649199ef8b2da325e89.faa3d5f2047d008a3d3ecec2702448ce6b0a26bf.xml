If you can determine the type of the object you are querying, check the specific content property that you know exists on that type. For example, if you know that the object you are querying is an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl>, check the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl.Items%2A> property to get a strongly typed collection, which has collection interface support and is probably more useful than an enumerator.\n  syntax:\n    content: public static System.Collections.IEnumerable GetChildren (System.Windows.DependencyObject current);\n    parameters:\n    - id: current\n      type: System.Windows.DependencyObject\n      description: The object from which to start processing the logical tree.
