Any server control can be made to function like a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, and will have the same consistent user interface (UI) elements such as verbs, icons, a title, and a header. Developers benefit from the GenericWebPart control because it enables them to reuse existing user controls and server controls within Web Parts applications.      > [!NOTE] >  When you create Web Parts pages, you do not have to do anything to enable an existing user control or custom control to be wrapped with the GenericWebPart control. Simply add your server or user control to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone, either programmatically or by declaring it in the page's markup, and the Web Parts control set automatically wraps your control with a GenericWebPart object at run time.       Because server controls that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones are wrapped with a GenericWebPart control at run time, developers can use ordinary server and user controls exactly as if they were <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Note that, if you declare custom controls that inherit from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>, these controls cannot support the use of the intrinsic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> properties. Thus, you cannot declare the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties on such controls, including properties such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Title%2A> property and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Description%2A> property. In contrast, other types of server controls (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, user controls, and custom controls that inherit from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl>) can declare these properties, because they support the use of expando properties.       Expando properties are actually strings that can be added to a class dynamically as a property, by means of the <xref:System.Web.UI.IAttributeAccessor> interface. Controls that implement this interface, including the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl> class and its children, can use expando properties. Because the base <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class does not support expando properties, when a custom control that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class is placed in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> and wrapped with a GenericWebPart control at run time, the Web Parts control set cannot dynamically add the intrinsic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties to the custom control. You have two choices in this case. You can use the custom control without the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties, or you can implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface in the custom control, enabling it to use the properties.       As an example of how controls that inherit from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl> can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties, if you declare an ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control in the markup of a page (within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone) at design time, even though this control does not inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class and does not natively contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> members, you can still treat it exactly like a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. You can declare <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> properties on the calendar control, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Title%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Description%2A>, and others. At run time, you can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetGenericWebPart%2A> method, which returns the GenericWebPart control that is dynamically wrapping the calendar control, and work with it programmatically exactly as you would with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, with access to all the same properties, events, and methods.       The GenericWebPart control has a critical property that allows you to access its underlying server control: the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.ChildControl%2A> property. This property allows developers to programmatically access the server control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.ChildControl%2A> property is also used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control to access personalization data from the child control, and to perform authorization, if the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property is set.       The GenericWebPart control has several other properties, all of which override properties inherited from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class. As noted, you can use these properties with any child control, so that it can behave as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. One important property is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property; it determines whether all the exportable properties, or only those marked as non-sensitive, can be exported. The UI-oriented properties inherited from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Description%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Height%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Title%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.TitleUrl%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Width%2A>, can be set in the declarative markup for any server control that is placed in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone.       Important methods in the GenericWebPart class include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.CreateControlCollection%2A> method, which creates the collection of controls (including child controls) associated with a GenericWebPart control, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Render%2A> method, which delegates all rendering to the wrapped child controls. The constructors on the GenericWebPart class are protected and are intended either for internal use or for extensibility scenarios.       There are some additional helpful insights for working with GenericWebPart controls. If you want to set default values for the overridden properties in the GenericWebPart class, your user control or custom server control can implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebActionable> interfaces, and override their members. At run time, the GenericWebPart control will get its values for the implemented properties from the child control that implements the interfaces. If your control defines any of its properties as personalizable (by using the `Personalizable` metadata attribute), the GenericWebPart control automatically enables those properties for personalization at run time, just like the personalizable properties on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.       If you want to provide Web Parts editing features for your control, you can implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable> interface. At run time, when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts%2A> method is called, the GenericWebPart control's code for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.WebBrowsableObject%2A> property will call into the same property in the child control, and use the child control's implementation to create associated custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"The GenericWebPart control exists to provide a run-time wrapper for server controls that are not &lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart&gt;

When developers add server controls--such as user controls, ASP.NET server controls, or existing custom controls--to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> control, the GenericWebPart control automatically wraps the server controls at run time so they can exhibit the same functionality as true <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.  \\n  \\n The following table compares and contrasts GenericWebPart controls and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.  \\n  \\n|GenericWebPart control|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control|  \\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  \\n|Exists to equip server controls that are not <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls with Web Parts functionality, so that any ASP.NET, custom, or user control can participate in Web Parts applications.|Exists to create custom ASP.NET controls that have native Web Parts functionality built in. This includes personalization, connections, import and export, and drag-and-drop capabilities.|  \\n|Is never declared in the markup of a page. It exists only to wrap server controls at run time, and to give the wrapped control (or child control) the full functionality of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.|Can be declared in the markup of a page at design time, like an ASP.NET server control, except that it is declared in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone.|  \\n|Includes and integrates its child control into the Web Parts personalization process so that it can act as a true <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.

Any server control can be made to function like a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, and will have the same consistent user interface (UI) elements such as verbs, icons, a title, and a header. Developers benefit from the GenericWebPart control because it enables them to reuse existing user controls and server controls within Web Parts applications.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  When you create Web Parts pages, you do not have to do anything to enable an existing user control or custom control to be wrapped with the GenericWebPart control. Simply add your server or user control to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone, either programmatically or by declaring it in the page's markup, and the Web Parts control set automatically wraps your control with a GenericWebPart object at run time.  \\n  \\n Because server controls that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones are wrapped with a GenericWebPart control at run time, developers can use ordinary server and user controls exactly as if they were <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Note that, if you declare custom controls that inherit from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>, these controls cannot support the use of the intrinsic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> properties. Thus, you cannot declare the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties on such controls, including properties such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Title%2A> property and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Description%2A> property. In contrast, other types of server controls (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, user controls, and custom controls that inherit from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl>) can declare these properties, because they support the use of expando properties.  \\n  \\n Expando properties are actually strings that can be added to a class dynamically as a property, by means of the <xref:System.Web.UI.IAttributeAccessor> interface. Controls that implement this interface, including the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl> class and its children, can use expando properties. Because the base <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class does not support expando properties, when a custom control that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class is placed in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> and wrapped with a GenericWebPart control at run time, the Web Parts control set cannot dynamically add the intrinsic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties to the custom control. You have two choices in this case. You can use the custom control without the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties, or you can implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface in the custom control, enabling it to use the properties.  \\n  \\n As an example of how controls that inherit from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl> can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties, if you declare an ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control in the markup of a page (within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone) at design time, even though this control does not inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class and does not natively contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> members, you can still treat it exactly like a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. You can declare <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> properties on the calendar control, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Title%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Description%2A>, and others. At run time, you can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetGenericWebPart%2A> method, which returns the GenericWebPart control that is dynamically wrapping the calendar control, and work with it programmatically exactly as you would with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, with access to all the same properties, events, and methods.  \\n  \\n The GenericWebPart control has a critical property that allows you to access its underlying server control: the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.ChildControl%2A> property. This property allows developers to programmatically access the server control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.ChildControl%2A> property is also used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control to access personalization data from the child control, and to perform authorization, if the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property is set.  \\n  \\n The GenericWebPart control has several other properties, all of which override properties inherited from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class. As noted, you can use these properties with any child control, so that it can behave as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. One important property is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property; it determines whether all the exportable properties, or only those marked as non-sensitive, can be exported. The UI-oriented properties inherited from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Description%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Height%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Title%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.TitleUrl%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Width%2A>, can be set in the declarative markup for any server control that is placed in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone.  \\n  \\n Important methods in the GenericWebPart class include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.CreateControlCollection%2A> method, which creates the collection of controls (including child controls) associated with a GenericWebPart control, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.Render%2A> method, which delegates all rendering to the wrapped child controls. The constructors on the GenericWebPart class are protected and are intended either for internal use or for extensibility scenarios.  \\n  \\n There are some additional helpful insights for working with GenericWebPart controls. If you want to set default values for the overridden properties in the GenericWebPart class, your user control or custom server control can implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebActionable> interfaces, and override their members. At run time, the GenericWebPart control will get its values for the implemented properties from the child control that implements the interfaces. If your control defines any of its properties as personalizable (by using the `Personalizable` metadata attribute), the GenericWebPart control automatically enables those properties for personalization at run time, just like the personalizable properties on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n If you want to provide Web Parts editing features for your control, you can implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable> interface. At run time, when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts%2A> method is called, the GenericWebPart control's code for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart.WebBrowsableObject%2A> property will call into the same property in the child control, and use the child control's implementation to create associated custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how the GenericWebPart control automatically wraps a server control that is not a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control at run time.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example contains a Web Parts page with two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls. Within each zone is a standard ASP.NET server control. Because the controls are in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone, they will be automatically wrapped with a GenericWebPart control when the page is compiled. So, you can declare <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class properties on these controls. After you load the page in a browser, if you click the **Display All Property Values** button, the details for each control are displayed in a label. To show how the GenericWebPart control works, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control in the first zone has some of the GenericWebPart properties set in the declarative markup of the .aspx page, whereas the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BulletedList> control does not. After you load the page, note the differences in the property values for the two controls, and that both have a parent GenericWebPart control.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_GenericWebPart_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_348_1.aspx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_GenericWebPart_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_348_1.aspx)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example shows a partial class that accesses some properties of the GenericWebPart control programmatically. Notice that in the `Page_Load` method, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetGenericWebPart%2A> method is used to retrieve the run-time instance of the GenericWebPart control that wraps a server control. This approach of getting a reference to the parent GenericWebPart control enables you to work programmatically with an ordinary server or user control as if it were a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control at run time.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_GenericWebPart_Overview#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_348_2.cs)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_GenericWebPart_Overview#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_348_2.vb)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItem(false)]\n\n      public class GenericWebPart : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart\n  inheritance:\n  -
