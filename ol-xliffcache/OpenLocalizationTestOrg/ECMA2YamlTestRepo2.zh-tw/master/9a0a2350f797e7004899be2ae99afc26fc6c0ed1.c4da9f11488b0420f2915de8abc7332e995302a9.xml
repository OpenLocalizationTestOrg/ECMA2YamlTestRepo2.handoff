This works well with encodings that are similar to the textual XML encoding. However, there are some encodings that do not place XML infoset information (For example, tags for starting and ending XML elements) together with the data contained within elements. For example, in the MTOM encoding, the message is split into multiple parts. One part contains the XML infoset, which may contain references to other parts for actual element contents. Since the XML infoset will normally be small compared to the streamed contents, it makes sense to buffer the infoset, write it out, and then write the contents in a streamed way.

For example, the textual and binary XML writers will call it immediately and write out the streamed contents in between the start and end tags.
