The WebPartHelpMode enumeration contains values that can be applied to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property. The default value for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property is Modal.\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property to display Help for a control in the same browser window. The first part of this example assumes the use of a custom control, `TextDisplayWebPart`, which is found in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class overview.  \\n  \\n The code example also includes an HTML page that contains fictitious Help content for the `TextDisplayWebPart` control. For this example to work, you must save the following code in a file named Textwebparthelp.htm and place it in the same directory of your site as the .aspx page.  \\n  \\n```  \\n<html>  \\n<head runat=\\\"server\\\">  \\n    <title>Text Content WebPart Help</title>  \\n</head>  \\n<body>  \\n  <div>  \\n  <h1>Text Content WebPart Help</h1>  \\n  To make the WebPart control work...  \\n  </div>  \\n</body>  \\n</html>  \\n```  \\n  \\n The final part of the example is a Web page that shows how to reference the `TextDisplayWebPart` control. Note that in the declarative markup, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property value is set to Navigate, and the code also sets the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpUrl%2A> property to the name of the HTML file that contains the Help content. Load the page into a browser, and click the help verb on the verbs menu of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPart_HelpMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_134_1.aspx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_HelpMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_134_1.aspx)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public enum WebPartHelpMode\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartHelpMode.Modal\n  id: Modal\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartHelpMode\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Modal\n  nameWithType: WebPartHelpMode.Modal\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartHelpMode.Modal\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Opens a separate browser window, if the browser has this capability.
