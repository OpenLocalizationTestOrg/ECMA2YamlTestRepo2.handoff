However, if an application needs to perform custom unhandled exception processing from a centralized location, you should handle DispatcherUnhandledException.       DispatcherUnhandledException is raised by an <xref:System.Windows.Application> for each exception that is unhandled by code running on the main UI thread.       If an exception is not handled on either a background [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] thread (a thread with its own <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher>) or a background worker thread (a thread without a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher>), the exception is not forwarded to the main [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] thread. Consequently, DispatcherUnhandledException is not raised. In these circumstances, you will need to write code to do the following:      1.  Handle exceptions on the background thread.      2.  Dispatch those exceptions to the main [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] thread.      3.  Rethrow them on the main [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] thread without handling them to allow DispatcherUnhandledException to be raised.       For more information, see the [Threading Model](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) overview.       The DispatcherUnhandledException event handler is passed a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs> argument that contains contextual information regarding the exception, including:      -   The exception (<xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs.Exception%2A>).      -   The <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> from which it originated (<xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherEventArgs.Dispatcher%2A>).       You can use this information to determine whether an exception is recoverable or not. A recoverable exception might be a <xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>, for example, while an unrecoverable exception might be a <xref:System.StackOverflowException>, for example.       When you process an unhandled exception from DispatcherUnhandledException, and you don't want [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] to continue processing it, you need to set the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs.Handled%2A> property to `true`.       Unlike the other events that <xref:System.Windows.Application> raises, DispatcherUnhandledException does not have a matching protected virtual implementation (OnDispatcherUnhandledException).

Additionally, the Resources property is included in the resource lookup path, which is traversed in the following order:      1.  Elements      2.  Windows      3.  Resources      4.  System       Consequently, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] elements can bind to application-scope resources. Additionally, if resources change, the resource system ensures that element properties which are bound to those resources are automatically updated to reflect the change.       Application-scope resources provide a simple way to support a consistent theme across your application. You can easily create a theme in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] by using the `Application.Resources` tag. However, if your application supports multiple themes, which may contain a large number of theme elements, it might be easier to manage them using one <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary> instance for each theme. In this way, a new theme can be applied by setting the Resources property to the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary>.       There are two considerations to make when using Resources. First, the dictionary *key* is an object, so you need to use exactly the same object instance when both setting and getting a property value (note that the key is case-sensitive when using a string). Second, the dictionary *value* is an object, so you will need to convert the value to the desired type when getting a property value.

For example, an application may have data that is in an inconsistent state, or in the middle of a long-running operation. In these situations, it may be desirable to prevent the session from ending, and may be more desirable to allow users the option to decide whether or not to let the session to end.  \\n  \\n You can detect when a session ends by handling the SessionEnding event. If an application needs to prevent the session from ending, the <xref:System.Windows.SessionEndingCancelEventArgs> argument that is passed to the event handler exposes the <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs.Cancel%2A> that you set to `true` (the default value is `false`).  \\n  \\n If SessionEnding is unhandled, or is handled without being cancelled, <xref:System.Windows.Application.Shutdown%2A> is called and the <xref:System.Windows.Application.Exit> event is raised.  \\n  \\n To obtain more information about why the session is ending, an application can inspect <xref:System.Windows.SessionEndingCancelEventArgs.ReasonSessionEnding%2A>, which is one of the <xref:System.Windows.ReasonSessionEnding> values (<xref:System.Windows.ReasonSessionEnding> and <xref:System.Windows.ReasonSessionEnding>).  \\n  \\n SessionEnding is not raised by console applications.  \\n  \\n SessionEnding is raised only on the thread that creates the <xref:System.Windows.Application> object.  \\n  \\n SessionEnding is not raised for [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)].\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates how to handle the SessionEnding event and allow the user to cancel it.  \\n  \\n [!code-xml[ApplicationSessionEndingSnippets#HandlingSessionEndingXAML](~/add/codesnippet/xaml/ApplicationSessionEndingSnippets.CSharp/App.xaml#handlingsessionendingxaml)]  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[ApplicationSessionEndingSnippets#HandlingSessionEndingCODEBEHIND](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/applicationsessionendingsnippets/application.xaml.vb#handlingsessionendingcodebehind)]\\n [!code-cs[ApplicationSessionEndingSnippets#HandlingSessionEndingCODEBEHIND](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/ApplicationSessionEndingSnippets.CSharp/App.xaml.cs#handlingsessionendingcodebehind)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public event System.Windows.SessionEndingCancelEventHandler SessionEnding;\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.SessionEndingCancelEventHandler\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Application.SetCookie(System.Uri,System.String)\n  id: SetCookie(System.Uri,System.String)\n  parent: System.Windows.Application\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: SetCookie(Uri,String)\n  nameWithType: Application.SetCookie(Uri,String)\n  fullName: System.Windows.Application.SetCookie(Uri,String)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Creates a cookie for the location specified by a <xref:System.Uri>.\n  remarks: \"A cookie is an arbitrary piece of data that can be stored by an application on the client machine during application sessions (session cookies) or across application sessions (persistent cookies).
