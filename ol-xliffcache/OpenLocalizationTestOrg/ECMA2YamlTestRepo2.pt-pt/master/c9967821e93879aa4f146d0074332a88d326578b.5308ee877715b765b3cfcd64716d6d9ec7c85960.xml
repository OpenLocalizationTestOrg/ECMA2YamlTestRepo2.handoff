The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control in the example displays optional node tags alongside the standard node labels. Node tags are specified using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Tag%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control also uses custom colors, including a custom highlight color.  \\n  \\n You can customize most of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> colors by setting color properties, but the selection highlight color is not available as a property. Additionally, the default selection highlight rectangle extends only around a node label. Owner drawing must be used to draw the node tags and to draw a customized highlight rectangle large enough to include a node tag.  \\n  \\n In the example, a handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawNode?displayProperty=fullName> event draws the node tags and the custom selection highlight manually. Unselected nodes do not need customization. For these, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.DrawDefault%2A> property is set to `true` so that they will be drawn by the operating system.  \\n  \\n Additionally, a handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event provides hit-testing. By default, a node can be selected only by clicking the region around its label.
