In addition to the methods and functionality inherited from the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner> class, ControlDesigner provides additional methods to support extending and altering the behavior of an associated <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> at design time.  \\n  \\n You can associate a designer with a type using a <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerAttribute>. For an overview of customizing design time behavior, see [Extending Design-Time Support](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example ControlDesigner implementation demonstrates handling `MouseEnter` and `MouseLeave` events, drawing on a control from designer code, and using part of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerFilter> interface to add a property for the control at design time. The following sample code contains a designer and a sample user control associated with the designer. To build this sample, compile the sample into a class library, add a reference to the library to a Windows Forms project, add the control to the Toolbox, and add an instance of the control to your form. When you point to the control, the inner outline of the perimeter of the control is highlighted, and the color used to draw the outline corresponds to the `OutlineColor` property that the designer has added to the properties listed for the control.  \\n  \\n Add a reference to the System.Design assembly to compile the code example.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[ControlDesignerExample#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.windows.forms.d_132_1.cpp)]\\n [!code-vb[ControlDesignerExample#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.d_132_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[ControlDesignerExample#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.d_132_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class ControlDesigner : System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner'\n  inheritance:\n  -
