A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ListBox> control is populated with the ContentDirection enumeration values. The display direction of the label and radio buttons in the panel change based on the value that the user selects from the list box. Because this example uses English text, when the RightToLeft value is selected, the text is justified on the right side of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Panel> control, but the left-to-right order of the English text is maintained. In a real-world application, you would not set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Panel.Direction%2A> property to the RightToLeft value, if you were displaying text for a language that uses left-to-right order.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[Panel.Direction#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_218_1.aspx)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public enum ContentDirection\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Enum\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.LeftToRight\n  id: LeftToRight\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: LeftToRight\n  nameWithType: ContentDirection.LeftToRight\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.LeftToRight\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls\n  summary: Left to right.\n  syntax:\n    content: LeftToRight\n    return:\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.NotSet\n  id: NotSet\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: NotSet\n  nameWithType: ContentDirection.NotSet\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.NotSet\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls\n  summary: Not set.\n  syntax:\n    content: NotSet\n    return:\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.RightToLeft\n  id: RightToLeft\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: RightToLeft\n  nameWithType: ContentDirection.RightToLeft\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.RightToLeft\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls\n  summary: Right to left.\n  syntax:\n    content: RightToLeft\n    return:\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n      description: To be added.\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Enum\n  isExternal: false\n  name: System.Enum\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.LeftToRight\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n  isExternal: false\n  name: LeftToRight\n  nameWithType: ContentDirection.LeftToRight\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.LeftToRight\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls\n  isExternal: false\n  name: ContentDirection\n  nameWithType: ContentDirection\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.NotSet\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n  isExternal: false\n  name: NotSet\n  nameWithType: ContentDirection.NotSet\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.NotSet\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.RightToLeft\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection\n  isExternal: false\n  name: RightToLeft\n  nameWithType: ContentDirection.RightToLeft\n  fullName: System.Web.UI.WebControls.ContentDirection.RightToLeft\n"}
