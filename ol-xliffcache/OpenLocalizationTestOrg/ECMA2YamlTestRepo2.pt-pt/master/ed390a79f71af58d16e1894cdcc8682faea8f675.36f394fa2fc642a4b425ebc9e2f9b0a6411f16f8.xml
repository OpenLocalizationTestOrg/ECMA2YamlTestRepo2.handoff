The matching child code group type determines how all child groups under it are applied, depending on how the <xref:System.Security.Policy.CodeGroup.Resolve%2A> methods of these child groups work.  \\n  \\n The .NET Framework security system uses <xref:System.Security.Policy.CodeGroup.Resolve%2A> on the policy levels to determine which permissions to grant to loaded code from the resulting policy statements and the code request on the assembly.  \\n  \\n This operation of this method is as follows:  \\n  \\n If the membership condition does not match the specified evidence, return `null`; otherwise, set the permission set to be returned (P) equal to the code group's policy statement and continue. For each child code group, resolve the code group with the same evidence; if the result is not `null`, return that policy statement. If no child code group matched, return P (the parent's policy statement).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code shows the use of the Resolve method to resolve policy for the code group.
