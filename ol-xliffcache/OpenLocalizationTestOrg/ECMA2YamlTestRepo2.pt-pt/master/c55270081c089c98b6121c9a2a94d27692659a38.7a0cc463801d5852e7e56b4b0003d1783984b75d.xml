For example, a permission that represents access to C:\\\\example.txt is a subset of a permission that represents access to C:\\\\\\\\. If this method returns `true`, the current permission represents no more access to the protected resource than does the specified permission.  \\n  \\n The following statements are required to be true for all implementations of the IsSubsetOf method. `X`, `Y`, and `Z` represent <xref:System.Security.IPermission> objects that are not `null`.  \\n  \\n-   `X`.IsSubsetOf(`X`) returns `true`.  \\n  \\n-   `X`.IsSubsetOf(`Y`) returns the same value as `Y`.IsSubsetOf(`X`) if and only if `X` and `Y` represent the same set of permissions.  \\n  \\n-   If `X`.IsSubsetOf(`Y`) and `Y`.IsSubsetOf(`Z`) both return `true`, `X`.IsSubsetOf(`Z`) returns `true`.  \\n  \\n If `X` represents an empty <xref:System.Security.IPermission> object with a permission state of <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PermissionState> and `Y` represents an <xref:System.Security.IPermission> object that is `null`, `X`.IsSubsetOf(`Y`) returns `true`. If `Z` is also an empty permission, the compound set operation `X`.Union(Z).IsSubsetOf(Y) also returns `true` because the union of two empty permissions is an empty permission.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates implementing the IsSubsetOf method.
