HtmlWindow acts as a logical container for a Web page's documents and its metadata, such as the document's location and the capabilities of the Web browser.

Rather, HtmlWindow provides high-level descriptions of a document's location on a user's screen, as well as methods for interacting with users by way of prompts and dialog boxes. HtmlWindow acts as a logical container for a Web page's documents and its metadata, such as the document's location and the capabilities of the Web browser.  \\n  \\n A Web page consists of a single document, or a `FRAMESET` containing one or more `FRAME` elements, each of which hosts its own document. Web developers use framesets to show logically related pages side by side (for example, a content page next to a navigation page). When a page consists of a single document, you can access it through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Document%2A> property of HtmlWindow; if the page uses frames, you can access their documents through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Frames%2A> collection, which consists of one or more HtmlWindow objects.  \\n  \\n When your host the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser> control in a Windows Forms application, you can choose to interact with the user using standard Windows Forms classes, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox>, or you can use methods on HtmlWindow defined for this purpose. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Alert%2A> method presents a simple dialog box with custom text and an **OK** button; <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Prompt%2A> presents a line of custom text and a text input field to the user; and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Confirm%2A> presents a dialog box with a line of custom text and **OK** and **Cancel** buttons.  \\n  \\n You can use HtmlWindow to open new windows containing new documents. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Open%2A> loads the specified URL into the named window, creating it if it does not already exist, while <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.OpenNew%2A> always opens its URL in a newly created window.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example contains two methods. The first opens a URL in a window named `displayWindow`, which it creates with a status bar displayed. The second opens another URL in the same window, but specifies that only the location bar should be displayed. Notice that the dimensions of the window and the controls that are displayed depends on which URL is opened first. The code example requires that your form contains a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser> control named `WebBrowser1`.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow#13](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/HtmlWindowProject/Form1.vb#13)]\\n [!code-cs[System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow#13](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/HtmlWindowProjectCSharp/Form1.cs#13)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public sealed class HtmlWindow\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Alert(System.String)\n  id: Alert(System.String)\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Alert(String)\n  nameWithType: HtmlWindow.Alert(String)\n  fullName: System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow.Alert(String)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Displays a message box.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> class offers a more powerful version of the Alert method.  \\n  \\n Although Alert accepts Unicode text as input, the Internet Explorer script prompt will not display non-Latin language text appropriately on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME or Windows NT due to operating system limitations.
