When the user switches back to Source view, the design-time control is persisted to markup source code and edited into the markup for the Web page. The HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner class provides design-time support for controls that are derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> in a designer host.  \\n  \\n The HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner class properties provide the following functionality:  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.ActionLists%2A> property returns a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionListCollection> object, which typically contains an object that is derived from the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionList> class for each level in the inheritance tree of the designer.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DataSourceDesigner%2A> property provides access to the designer of the data source, if one is defined.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DesignerView%2A> property gets the default view of the data source that is bound to the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.UseDataSourcePickerActionList%2A> property determines whether the control should render its default action lists for choosing and creating data sources.  \\n  \\n The HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner class methods provide the following functionality:  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.ConnectToDataSource%2A> method performs the actions that are necessary to connect to the current data source.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.CreateDataSource%2A> method creates a new data source for the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DataBind%2A> method binds the associated control that is derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> class to a design-time data source.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DisconnectFromDataSource%2A> method performs the actions that are necessary to disconnect from the current data source.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.GetDesignTimeDataSource%2A> method gets a data source that can be used at design time for the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.GetSampleDataSource%2A> method constructs a sample data source that can be used at design time for the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.PreFilterProperties%2A> method is used to remove properties from or add additional properties to or to shadow properties of the associated control that is derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> class.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how to extend the HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner class to change the appearance of controls that are derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> control at design time.  \\n  \\n The example derives the `MyHierarchicalDataBoundControl` class from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl>.
