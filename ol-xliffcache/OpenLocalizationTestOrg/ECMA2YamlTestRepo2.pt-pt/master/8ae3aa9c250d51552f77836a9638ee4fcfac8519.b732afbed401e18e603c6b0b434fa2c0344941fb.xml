The control plots two curves along with a legend. The `ChartControlAccessibleObject` class, which derives from `ControlAccessibleObject`, is used in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateAccessibilityInstance%2A> method to provide custom accessible information for the chart control. Because the chart legend is not an actual control based on <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control>, but instead is drawn by the chart control, it does not contain any built-in accessible information. Because of this, the `ChartControlAccessibleObject` class overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.GetChild%2A> method to return the `CurveLegendAccessibleObject` that represents accessible information for each part of the legend. When an accessible-aware application uses this control, the control can provide the necessary accessible information.  \\n  \\n This code excerpt demonstrates using the AccessibleStates enumeration with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.State%2A> property.
