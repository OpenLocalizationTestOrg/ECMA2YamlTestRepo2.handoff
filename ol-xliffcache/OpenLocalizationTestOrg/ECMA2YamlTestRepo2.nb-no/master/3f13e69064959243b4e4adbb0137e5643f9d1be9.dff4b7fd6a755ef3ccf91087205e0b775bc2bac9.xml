Many controls implement behavior where a certain event is marked as handled, and is replaced by another more intuitive event. Generally, a control will only mark a platform input event as handled if there is some design intention for doing so. In certain scenarios, those design intentions might not be what your particular handling of the input event requires. It is for these scenarios that registering handlers with `handledEventsToo` as `true` is appropriate. But you should not do this routinely. Invoking handlers in response to all events even if handled will complicate your own application event processing logic. You may see a decrease in performance if the handler logic is substantial. You should reserve the use of attaching handlers for already-handled events for situations where you have already discovered during the development process that certain controls are handling events that you still want to handle with application logic.       Another technique for avoiding the class handling behavior of certain event-control combinations is to use that event's preview alternative.

Although you can mark the <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> event as handled for purposes of this element, the handled state does not perpetuate to other elements along the event route. However, you might want to mark the event as handled in order to prevent general instance handlers (those that did not specify `handledEventsToo`) from being invoked.       The default implementation for general mouse event handling in <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> listens for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> and converts it to an appropriate local event. If you want to override this logic, you must create a derived class. In the static constructor of your derived class, register an alternative class handler for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName>. You cannot change the mouse handling behavior of <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> by overriding OnMouseLeftButtonDown.

See Remark below.       The TextInput event may already be marked as handled by the internal implementations of composited controls. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> is a composited control where the TextInput event is already marked as handled; within its compositing. Controls do this because the control needs to interpret some types of input, such as arrow keys, as having special meaning to that control. If you use <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.PreviewTextInput> as the event where you attach handlers for text input, you may receive better results. This technique circumvents most cases where control composition has already marked this event as handled and prevents your handler from receiving the event along the event route.       The TextInput event allows a component or application to listen for text input in a device-independent manner. The keyboard is the primary means of TextInput, but speech, handwriting, and other input devices can also raise TextInput.

Content elements are designed for flow-style presentation, using an intuitive markup-oriented layout model and a deliberately simple object model.\n  remarks: \"ContentElement defines the following common content characteristics:  \\n  \\n-   Input: All ContentElement derived classes provide support for basic input capture from keyboard, mouse, drag-and-drop operations, stylus controls, and accelerators.  \\n  \\n-   Focus: All ContentElement derived classes are potentially focusable. (However, the default focusable state for the ContentElement base class is `false`. For details on how to make a ContentElement focusable, see <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.Focusable%2A>.) In addition, this class contains [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] that you can use for traversing the focus across related elements.  \\n  \\n-   Events: ContentElement includes events that are related to input and focus; it also includes events for changes in state. In many cases, the ContentElement events are routed events. In some cases, routed events have both tunneling and bubbling routing strategies, raised as separate events in response to the same state or condition. Also, ContentElement defines [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] that can raise routed events and that can add or remove handlers to events.  \\n  \\n ContentElement shares many common [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] with <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>. These common [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] do not come from a shared class inheritance. But they do share common naming, similar behavior, and similar internal implementation of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] in each class. The similarity is because ContentElement and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> are each classes that are an element base, although each has different intentions for its markup object model behavior.  \\n  \\n In particular, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> descends from <xref:System.Windows.Media.Visual>, which provides the lower-level graphics support for rendering a ContentElement to a rectangular region within a composited window, whereas ContentElement defers rendering so that concepts more common to document scenarios, such as flow and wrapping, are more easily supported. These two related classes also implement the common interfaces <xref:System.Windows.IInputElement> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.IAnimatable>.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class ContentElement : System.Windows.DependencyObject, System.Windows.IInputElement, System.Windows.Media.Animation.IAnimatable'\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject\n  implements:\n  - System.Windows.IInputElement\n  - System.Windows.Media.Animation.IAnimatable\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.ClearValue(System.Windows.DependencyProperty)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.ClearValue(System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.CoerceValue(System.Windows.DependencyProperty)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.DependencyObjectType\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetHashCode\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetLocalValueEnumerator\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue(System.Windows.DependencyProperty)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.InvalidateProperty(System.Windows.DependencyProperty)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.IsSealed\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.OnPropertyChanged(System.Windows.DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.ReadLocalValue(System.Windows.DependencyProperty)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetCurrentValue(System.Windows.DependencyProperty,System.Object)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue(System.Windows.DependencyProperty,System.Object)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue(System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey,System.Object)\n  - System.Windows.DependencyObject.ShouldSerializeProperty(System.Windows.DependencyProperty)\n  - System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject.CheckAccess\n  - System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject.Dispatcher\n  - System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject.VerifyAccess\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.ContentElement.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Windows.ContentElement\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: ContentElement()\n  nameWithType: ContentElement.ContentElement()\n  fullName: System.Windows.ContentElement.ContentElement()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationCore\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Windows.ContentElement\"></xref> class.\n  syntax:\n    content: public ContentElement ();\n    parameters: []\n  overload: System.Windows.ContentElement.#ctor*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Windows.ContentElement.AddHandler(System.Windows.RoutedEvent,System.Delegate)\n  id: AddHandler(System.Windows.RoutedEvent,System.Delegate)\n  parent: System.Windows.ContentElement\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AddHandler(RoutedEvent,Delegate)\n  nameWithType: ContentElement.AddHandler(RoutedEvent,Delegate)\n  fullName: System.Windows.ContentElement.AddHandler(RoutedEvent,Delegate)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationCore\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Adds a routed event handler for a specified routed event, adding the handler to the handler collection on the current element.\n  remarks: \"You can add the same handler for the same event multiple times without raising an exception.

Specify <code>handledEventsToo</code> as <xref uid=\"langword_csharp_true\" name=\"true\" href=\"\"></xref> to have the provided handler be invoked for routed event that had already been marked as handled by another element along the event route.\n  remarks: \"Processing low-level input events in a practical way is a complex task. Many controls implement behavior where a certain event is marked as handled, and is replaced by another more intuitive event. Generally, a control will only mark a platform input event as handled if there is some design intention for doing so. In certain scenarios, those design intentions might not be what your particular handling of the input event requires. It is for these scenarios that registering handlers with `handledEventsToo` as `true` is appropriate. But you should not do this routinely. Invoking handlers in response to all events even if handled will complicate your own application event processing logic. You may see a decrease in performance if the handler logic is substantial. You should reserve the use of attaching handlers for already-handled events for situations where you have already discovered during the development process that certain controls are handling events that you still want to handle with application logic.  \\n  \\n Another technique for avoiding the class handling behavior of certain event-control combinations is to use that event's preview alternative. For example, if <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> is marked handled by class handling, you might be able to add handlers for <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> instead.  \\n  \\n You can add the same handler for the same event multiple times without raising an exception.

For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> is a composited control where the TextInput event is already marked as handled; within its compositing.
