The Thumb can also be used to resize controls. For example, a Thumb control in the corner of a window can provide a location for the user to click with the mouse to start a resize operation.       Thumb provides <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragStarted>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragCompleted> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragDelta> events to manage drag operations associated with the mouse pointer. When the user presses the left mouse button, the Thumb control receives logical focus and mouse capture, and the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragStarted> event is raised. While the Thumb control has focus and mouse capture, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragDelta> event can be raised multiple times without limit. When the user releases the left mouse button, the Thumb control loses mouse capture and the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragCompleted> event is raised.       The event information provides a change in position, but does not reposition the Thumb. You must manually change or reposition the Thumb or any other elements that you want to resize or change as a result of the drag operation. The Thumb control does not provide drag-and-drop functionality.       A Thumb control can receive mouse capture, but cannot receive keyboard focus. Therefore, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsKeyboardFocused%2A> property that corresponds to keyboard focus is set to `false`. This value overrides the parent class <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> that sets this property to `true`.       To provide drag capability, class handling is provided for the <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseLeftButtonDown>, <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseLeftButtonUp> and <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseMove> events. For more information, see the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.OnMouseLeftButtonDown%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.OnMouseLeftButtonUp%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.OnMouseMove%2A> methods.       When a Thumb is part of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Track> control that scrolls content in a viewable area, or viewport, the size of the Thumb reflects the size of the viewport. For more information, see the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Track> class. The following illustration shows a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Track.Thumb%2A> control that is part of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> control.       ![Scrollbar illustration](~/add/media/scrollbar-illustration.JPG \"Scrollbar illustration\")      ## Customizing the Thumb Control    To apply the same property settings to multiple Thumb controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the Thumb, see [Thumb Syles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.

The Thumb can also be used to resize controls. For example, a Thumb control in the corner of a window can provide a location for the user to click with the mouse to start a resize operation.  \\n  \\n Thumb provides <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragStarted>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragCompleted> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragDelta> events to manage drag operations associated with the mouse pointer. When the user presses the left mouse button, the Thumb control receives logical focus and mouse capture, and the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragStarted> event is raised. While the Thumb control has focus and mouse capture, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragDelta> event can be raised multiple times without limit. When the user releases the left mouse button, the Thumb control loses mouse capture and the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.DragCompleted> event is raised.  \\n  \\n The event information provides a change in position, but does not reposition the Thumb. You must manually change or reposition the Thumb or any other elements that you want to resize or change as a result of the drag operation. The Thumb control does not provide drag-and-drop functionality.  \\n  \\n A Thumb control can receive mouse capture, but cannot receive keyboard focus. Therefore, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsKeyboardFocused%2A> property that corresponds to keyboard focus is set to `false`. This value overrides the parent class <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> that sets this property to `true`.  \\n  \\n To provide drag capability, class handling is provided for the <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseLeftButtonDown>, <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseLeftButtonUp> and <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseMove> events. For more information, see the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.OnMouseLeftButtonDown%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.OnMouseLeftButtonUp%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb.OnMouseMove%2A> methods.  \\n  \\n When a Thumb is part of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Track> control that scrolls content in a viewable area, or viewport, the size of the Thumb reflects the size of the viewport. For more information, see the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Track> class. The following illustration shows a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Track.Thumb%2A> control that is part of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> control.  \\n  \\n ![Scrollbar illustration](~/add/media/scrollbar-illustration.JPG \\\"Scrollbar illustration\\\")  \\n  \\n## Customizing the Thumb Control  \\n To apply the same property settings to multiple Thumb controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the Thumb, see [Thumb Syles and Templates](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in Button control's default template and is set by using a .
