IQueryAmbient is the specialized mechanism that avoids using reflection to determine information, and can also act situationally (a given object could choose to report `true` or `false` for <xref:System.Windows.Markup.IQueryAmbient.IsAmbientPropertyAvailable%2A>), whereas the attribute is essentially static analysis). <xref:System.Windows.Markup.AmbientAttribute> is the general mechanism that can be used by XAML object writers and that typically correlates to the dedicated XAML type system properties <xref:System.Xaml.XamlMember.IsAmbient%2A> and <xref:System.Xaml.XamlType.IsAmbient%2A>.      ## WPF Implementations of IQueryAmbient    In WPF, IQueryAmbient is used for the resource dictionary lookup process. The lookup process gets successive `Resources` values throughout the WPF logical tree, working towards the root of the resource scope until either a key is found or the key is determined to not exist in scope. Normally, doing so would require instantiating a <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary> each time to receive the results.
