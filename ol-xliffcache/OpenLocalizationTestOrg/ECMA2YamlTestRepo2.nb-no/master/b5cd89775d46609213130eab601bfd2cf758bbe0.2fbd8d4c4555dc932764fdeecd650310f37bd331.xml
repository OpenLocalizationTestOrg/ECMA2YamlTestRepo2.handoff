The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] contains a single default settings provider, LocalFileSettingsProvider, which stores configuration data to the local file system. An application settings property or group of properties are associated to a specific settings provider through the use of the <xref:System.Configuration.SettingsProviderAttribute>.       Typically, the client program does not explicitly access this class; rather, the application settings architecture automatically invokes the appropriate settings provider when its services are required. For example, many of the members of <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase> delegate their work to the associated settings provider.       LocalFileSettingsProvider persists settings to configuration files that have the extension `.config`. The contents of configuration files are structured as XML documents. Depending on whether the setting is scoped at either the application-level or user-level, the configuration data is stored as elements within an `<applicationSettings>` or a `<userSettings>` section group, respectively. Each of these section groups is represented by a corresponding <xref:System.Configuration.AppSettingsSection> or <xref:System.Configuration.ClientSettingsSection>, respectively. Each section object is owned and administered by a configuration section handler, which is an object of type <xref:System.Configuration.IConfigurationSectionHandler>.       Application-scoped settings and the default user-scoped settings are stored in a file named `application.exe.config`, which is created in the same directory as the executable file. Application configuration settings are read-only. Specific user data is stored in a file named `user.config`, stored under the user's home directory. If roaming profiles are enabled, two versions of the user configuration file could exist. In such a case, the entries in the roaming version take precedence over duplicated entries in the local user configuration file.

The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] contains a single default settings provider, LocalFileSettingsProvider, which stores configuration data to the local file system. An application settings property or group of properties are associated to a specific settings provider through the use of the <xref:System.Configuration.SettingsProviderAttribute>.  \\n  \\n Typically, the client program does not explicitly access this class; rather, the application settings architecture automatically invokes the appropriate settings provider when its services are required. For example, many of the members of <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase> delegate their work to the associated settings provider.  \\n  \\n LocalFileSettingsProvider persists settings to configuration files that have the extension `.config`. The contents of configuration files are structured as XML documents. Depending on whether the setting is scoped at either the application-level or user-level, the configuration data is stored as elements within an `<applicationSettings>` or a `<userSettings>` section group, respectively. Each of these section groups is represented by a corresponding <xref:System.Configuration.AppSettingsSection> or <xref:System.Configuration.ClientSettingsSection>, respectively. Each section object is owned and administered by a configuration section handler, which is an object of type <xref:System.Configuration.IConfigurationSectionHandler>.  \\n  \\n Application-scoped settings and the default user-scoped settings are stored in a file named `application.exe.config`, which is created in the same directory as the executable file. Application configuration settings are read-only. Specific user data is stored in a file named `user.config`, stored under the user's home directory. If roaming profiles are enabled, two versions of the user configuration file could exist. In such a case, the entries in the roaming version take precedence over duplicated entries in the local user configuration file.  \\n  \\n For more information about application settings, see [Application Settings for Windows Forms](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class LocalFileSettingsProvider : System.Configuration.SettingsProvider, System.Configuration.IApplicationSettingsProvider'\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase\n  - System.Configuration.SettingsProvider\n  implements:\n  - System.Configuration.IApplicationSettingsProvider\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Description\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Name\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: LocalFileSettingsProvider()\n  nameWithType: LocalFileSettingsProvider.LocalFileSettingsProvider()\n  fullName: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.LocalFileSettingsProvider()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  namespace: System.Configuration\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: The default constructor sets the <xref:System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.ApplicationName%2A> property to <xref:System.String.Empty>.\n  syntax:\n    content: public LocalFileSettingsProvider ();\n    parameters: []\n  overload: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.#ctor*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.ApplicationName\n  id: ApplicationName\n  parent: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: ApplicationName\n  nameWithType: LocalFileSettingsProvider.ApplicationName\n  fullName: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.ApplicationName\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  namespace: System.Configuration\n  summary: Gets or sets the name of the currently running application.\n  remarks: The ApplicationName and <xref:System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Name%2A> properties help to disambiguate similarly named setting properties in different applications.\n  syntax:\n    content: public override string ApplicationName { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.String\n      description: A string that contains the application's display name.\n  overload: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.ApplicationName*\n  exceptions: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\n- uid: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.GetPreviousVersion(System.Configuration.SettingsContext,System.Configuration.SettingsProperty)\n  id: GetPreviousVersion(System.Configuration.SettingsContext,System.Configuration.SettingsProperty)\n  parent: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: GetPreviousVersion(SettingsContext,SettingsProperty)\n  nameWithType: LocalFileSettingsProvider.GetPreviousVersion(SettingsContext,SettingsProperty)\n  fullName: System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.GetPreviousVersion(SettingsContext,SettingsProperty)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  namespace: System.Configuration\n  summary: Returns the value of the named settings property for the previous version of the same application.\n  remarks: The GetPreviousVersion method is often used in conjunction with the <xref:System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider.Upgrade%2A> method when migrating application settings during the installation of a new version of an application.
