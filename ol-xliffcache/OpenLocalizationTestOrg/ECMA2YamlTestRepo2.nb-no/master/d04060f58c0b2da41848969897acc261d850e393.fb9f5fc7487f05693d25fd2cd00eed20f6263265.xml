The WebPartZoneBase class is a zone that inherits from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class and provides a base set of behaviors for derived zones that contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, server controls, and user controls. The combination of WebPartZoneBase zones with <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and other server) controls forms the primary UI of a Web Parts application, the normal view of a page that users interact with most of the time.       All zones provide a common set of UI elements for the controls they contain. For a detailed discussion of the UI elements common to all zones, see the class overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class. The WebPartZoneBase zone includes a body section that contains server controls, and an associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> object used for rendering the contained controls and their chrome elements, such as their verbs, borders, and so on.       In addition to the features inherited from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class, the WebPartZoneBase class adds client-side control dragging, specific verbs (to enable common UI actions such as minimizing, closing, deleting, and editing controls), and additional style features. The WebPartZoneBase class is also the class to inherit from if you want to design a custom zone that is database-driven. For example, you could create a custom weather Web Parts zone that inherits from WebPartZoneBase, and is designed to contain and provide layout features and other services for <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that are data-bound and display weather information.       The WebPartZoneBase class contains a number of properties for working with style attributes in a zone. There are several properties for borders, including <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.BorderStyle%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.BorderWidth%2A>. There is a group of properties for working with style attributes of menus that can appear in the header of a zone, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.MenuLabelStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.MenuVerbStyle%2A>, and others.       The WebPartZoneBase class also contains a number of members for handling verbs in a zone. These members relate to the verbs that appear on the part controls in the zone. While zone-level verbs can be added to WebPartZoneBase zones, by default they do not have any. There is a set of standard verbs provided with the Web Parts control set for use with part controls, and developers can add custom verbs as well. Some important properties for working with verbs include properties that reference some of the standard verb objects, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CloseVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.ConnectVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.DeleteVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.EditVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.HelpVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.MinimizeVerb%2A>. The standard verbs appear on a verbs menu (typically presented in the UI as a drop-down menu) in the title bar of each control contained in a zone. There is also a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.VerbButtonType%2A> property that allows you to determine what type of clickable object represents a verb in the UI.       Other key members for working with verbs include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.OnCreateVerbs%2A> method, which is an event handler that can be overridden for custom handling of the verb creation process, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CreateVerbs> event.       The WebPartZoneBase class contains a number of members for working with <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls contained within a zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.WebParts%2A> property references the collection of all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and other server) controls in the zone. Several methods correspond to the standard verbs or actions that a user can carry out on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in a zone, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CloseWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.ConnectWebPart%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.EditWebPart%2A>.       There are also a number of members in the WebPartZoneBase class that concern how the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls are laid out or arranged within the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.AllowLayoutChange%2A> property determines whether controls can be moved among zones or rearranged within a zone by users. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> property allows you to determine whether the controls in a zone are arranged horizontally or vertically.      > [!NOTE] >  Internet Explorer might render the height of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> or its contained controls in an unexpected way, depending on the orientation of the zone. For more details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Height%2A> properties.       Other methods in the WebPartZoneBase class provide you with detailed programmatic control over the rendering of the various areas of a zone. Many of these methods override the base methods inherited from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class, to customize the rendering for zones that contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Important methods include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.Render%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.RenderBody%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.RenderDropCue%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.RenderHeader%2A>.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"extradata":"MT","nodes":[{"content":"In the Web Parts control set, a zone is a composite control, rendered as an HTML table, that contains other controls in a defined region of a Web page.","pos":[0,151]},{"content":"The WebPartZoneBase class is a zone that inherits from the base &lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone&gt;

Internet Explorer can affect the height of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, and the height of the zone that contains it.

The WebPartZoneBase class is a zone that inherits from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class and provides a base set of behaviors for derived zones that contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, server controls, and user controls. The combination of WebPartZoneBase zones with <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and other server) controls forms the primary UI of a Web Parts application, the normal view of a page that users interact with most of the time.  \\n  \\n All zones provide a common set of UI elements for the controls they contain. For a detailed discussion of the UI elements common to all zones, see the class overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class. The WebPartZoneBase zone includes a body section that contains server controls, and an associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> object used for rendering the contained controls and their chrome elements, such as their verbs, borders, and so on.  \\n  \\n In addition to the features inherited from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class, the WebPartZoneBase class adds client-side control dragging, specific verbs (to enable common UI actions such as minimizing, closing, deleting, and editing controls), and additional style features. The WebPartZoneBase class is also the class to inherit from if you want to design a custom zone that is database-driven. For example, you could create a custom weather Web Parts zone that inherits from WebPartZoneBase, and is designed to contain and provide layout features and other services for <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that are data-bound and display weather information.  \\n  \\n The WebPartZoneBase class contains a number of properties for working with style attributes in a zone. There are several properties for borders, including <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.BorderStyle%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.BorderWidth%2A>. There is a group of properties for working with style attributes of menus that can appear in the header of a zone, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.MenuLabelStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.MenuVerbStyle%2A>, and others.  \\n  \\n The WebPartZoneBase class also contains a number of members for handling verbs in a zone. These members relate to the verbs that appear on the part controls in the zone. While zone-level verbs can be added to WebPartZoneBase zones, by default they do not have any. There is a set of standard verbs provided with the Web Parts control set for use with part controls, and developers can add custom verbs as well. Some important properties for working with verbs include properties that reference some of the standard verb objects, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CloseVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.ConnectVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.DeleteVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.EditVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.HelpVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.MinimizeVerb%2A>. The standard verbs appear on a verbs menu (typically presented in the UI as a drop-down menu) in the title bar of each control contained in a zone. There is also a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.VerbButtonType%2A> property that allows you to determine what type of clickable object represents a verb in the UI.  \\n  \\n Other key members for working with verbs include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.OnCreateVerbs%2A> method, which is an event handler that can be overridden for custom handling of the verb creation process, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CreateVerbs> event.  \\n  \\n The WebPartZoneBase class contains a number of members for working with <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls contained within a zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.WebParts%2A> property references the collection of all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and other server) controls in the zone. Several methods correspond to the standard verbs or actions that a user can carry out on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in a zone, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CloseWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.ConnectWebPart%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.EditWebPart%2A>.  \\n  \\n There are also a number of members in the WebPartZoneBase class that concern how the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls are laid out or arranged within the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.AllowLayoutChange%2A> property determines whether controls can be moved among zones or rearranged within a zone by users. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> property allows you to determine whether the controls in a zone are arranged horizontally or vertically.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Internet Explorer might render the height of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> or its contained controls in an unexpected way, depending on the orientation of the zone. For more details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Height%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n Other methods in the WebPartZoneBase class provide you with detailed programmatic control over the rendering of the various areas of a zone. Many of these methods override the base methods inherited from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class, to customize the rendering for zones that contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Important methods include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.Render%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.RenderBody%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.RenderDropCue%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.RenderHeader%2A>.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebPartZoneBase class. The code shows how a derived class, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>, is used declaratively in a Web Parts page to contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. The code example has four sections: the first three sections describe the code files, and the fourth explains how to run the code.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is a user control that enables users to switch the page into different display modes. For more information on Web Parts display modes and a description of the code in this control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZoneBase_Overview#10](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_94_1.ascx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZoneBase_Overview#10](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_94_1.ascx)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example is a code-beside file that contains the code to handle events for the main Web page. The code in this file shows how to work with some of the key WebPartZoneBase members programmatically.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZoneBase_Overview#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_94_2.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZoneBase_Overview#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_94_2.cs)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is the Web page that contains the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls that exhibit behavior from the base WebPartZoneBase class, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls contained in the zones.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZoneBase_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_94_3.aspx)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZoneBase_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_94_3.aspx)]  \\n  \\n Load the Web page in a browser. Use the **Display Mode** drop-down list control to switch the page into design mode, click the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and try dragging them between the visible zones. Click some of the buttons on the page to see the effect of using various members of the WebPartZoneBase class. Next, switch the page to edit mode. Make sure a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is positioned in `WebPartZone2`, click the verbs menu on the control's title bar, and click **Edit** to edit the control. Finish editing that control, and then edit one of the controls in the other zone. As you carry out these steps, notice the differences in the UI styles of the controls and the zones, which are the effect of using the various members of the WebPartZoneBase class.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.Designer(\"System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBaseDesigner, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\")]\n\n      public abstract class WebPartZoneBase : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone, System.Web.UI.IPostBackEventHandler\n  inheritance:\n  -
