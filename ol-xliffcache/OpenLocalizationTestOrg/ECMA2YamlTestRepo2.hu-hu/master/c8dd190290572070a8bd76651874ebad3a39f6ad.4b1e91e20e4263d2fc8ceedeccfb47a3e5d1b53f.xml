You can also use the <xref:System.Net.WebClient> class to upload and download information from an FTP server. Using either of these approaches, when you specify a network resource that uses the FTP scheme (for example, `\"ftp://contoso.com\"`) the FtpWebRequest class provides the ability to programmatically interact with FTP servers.       The URI may be relative or absolute. If the URI is of the form `\"ftp://contoso.com/%2fpath\"` (%2f is an escaped '/'), then the URI is absolute, and the current directory is `/path`. If, however, the URI is of the form `\"ftp://contoso.com/path\"`, first the .NET Framework logs into the FTP server (using the user name and password set by the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.Credentials%2A> property), then the current directory is set to `<UserLoginDirectory>/path`.       You must have a valid user name and password for the server or the server must allow anonymous logon. You can specify the credentials used to connect to the server by setting the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.Credentials%2A> property or you can include them in the <xref:System.Uri.UserInfo%2A> portion of the URI passed to the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.Create%2A> method. If you include <xref:System.Uri.UserInfo%2A> information in the URI, the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.Credentials%2A> property is set to a new network credential with the specified user name and password information.      > [!CAUTION] >  Unless the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.EnableSsl%2A> property is `true`, all data and commands, including your user name and password information, are sent to the server in clear text. Anyone monitoring network traffic can view your credentials and use them to connect to the server. If you are connecting to an FTP server that requires credentials and supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), you should set <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.EnableSsl%2A> to `true`.       You must have <xref:System.Net.WebPermission> to access the FTP resource; otherwise, a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> exception is thrown.       Specify the FTP command to send to the server by setting the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.Method%2A> property to a value defined in the <xref:System.Net.WebRequestMethods.Ftp> structure. To transmit text data, change the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.UseBinary%2A> property from its default value (`true`) to `false`. For details and restrictions, see <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.Method%2A>.       When using an FtpWebRequest object to upload a file to a server, you must write the file content to the request stream obtained by calling the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.GetRequestStream%2A> method or its asynchronous counterparts, the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.BeginGetRequestStream%2A> and <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.EndGetRequestStream%2A> methods. You must write to the stream and close the stream before sending the request.       Requests are sent to the server by calling the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.GetResponse%2A> method or its asynchronous counterparts, the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.BeginGetResponse%2A> and <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.EndGetResponse%2A> methods. When the requested operation completes, an <xref:System.Net.FtpWebResponse> object is returned. The <xref:System.Net.FtpWebResponse> object provides the status of the operation and any data downloaded from the server.       You can set a time-out value for reading or writing to the server by using the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.ReadWriteTimeout%2A> property. If the time-out period is exceeded, the calling method throws a <xref:System.Net.WebException> with <xref:System.Net.WebExceptionStatus> set to <xref:System.Net.WebExceptionStatus>.       When downloading a file from an FTP server, if the command was successful, the contents of the requested file are available in the response object's stream. You can access this stream by calling the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebResponse.GetResponseStream%2A> method. For more information, see <xref:System.Net.FtpWebResponse>.       If the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.Proxy%2A> property is set, either directly or in a configuration file, communications with the FTP server are made through the specified proxy. If the specified proxy is an HTTP proxy, only the <xref:System.Net.WebRequestMethods.Ftp.DownloadFile>, <xref:System.Net.WebRequestMethods.Ftp.ListDirectory>, and <xref:System.Net.WebRequestMethods.Ftp.ListDirectoryDetails> commands are supported.       Only downloaded binary content is cached; that is, content received using the <xref:System.Net.WebRequestMethods.Ftp.DownloadFile> command with the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.UseBinary%2A> property set to `true`.
