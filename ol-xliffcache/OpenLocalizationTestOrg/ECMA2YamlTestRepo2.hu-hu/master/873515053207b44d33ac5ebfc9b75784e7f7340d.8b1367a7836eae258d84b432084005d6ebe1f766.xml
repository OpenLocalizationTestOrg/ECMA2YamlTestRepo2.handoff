There are several other types of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> classes; for more information, see the overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class. Like other tool zones, EditorZoneBase zones are not visible when a page is in normal browse mode; they are visible only when a page is in edit display mode. Also like the other tool zones, EditorZoneBase zones can only contain the special type of controls they were designed to contain (in this case, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls).       The EditorZoneBase zones provide a special UI for the editing controls they contain. Many of these UI elements are common to all zones in the Web Parts control set. For a detailed discussion of the common UI elements in Web Parts zones, see the class overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class.       Because the EditorZoneBase class is abstract, you cannot use it directly on a Web page. Instead, you must use a control that inherits from the EditorZoneBase class and implements its behavior. You can either use the derived zone that is provided in the Web Parts control set, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control, or you can derive your own custom EditorZoneBase control.       The EditorZoneBase class provides a common user interface (UI) to contain special controls that enable end users to edit the properties, layout, appearance, and other attributes of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Some properties that apply to the UI refer to verbs, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.ApplyVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CancelVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OKVerb%2A> properties. Verbs are common actions carried out by users on a page, and are represented in the UI by buttons, links, menu items, or other elements. For example, when users edit properties on a control they can click an apply verb to save the changes.       Several other properties affect text that is displayed at various points in the editing UI. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.ErrorText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.HeaderText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.InstructionText%2A> properties.       Two important properties provide references to related controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorParts%2A> property is a collection of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.WebPartToEdit%2A> property is an object reference to a control contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>--which might be a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control or any other ASP.NET server control, user control, or custom control currently being edited.       Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorPartChrome%2A> property references an instance of an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartChrome> object that is associated with the zone, and that contains style characteristics of the peripheral UI elements (known as chrome) such as title and border styles for <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone.       A number of the methods of the EditorZoneBase class are specialized to handle the editing of other controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.Close%2A> method changes the page from the edit display mode back to a normal browsing view. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorPartChrome%2A> method is for creating the chrome (peripheral UI elements such as a border, verbs, icons, and a title) that surrounds each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorParts%2A> method is an abstract method; derived classes override it to create instances of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.InvalidateEditorParts%2A> method can be called by a derived class if the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone changes for some programmatic reason, which flags the Web Parts control set to recreate and update the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OnDisplayModeChanged%2A> method is used to set the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to `null` when the display mode changes from edit mode back to browse mode. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OnSelectedWebPartChanged%2A> method is used for handling the event when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is either entering or leaving edit mode. For example, this method is a convenient place to synchronize the property values of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control with the editable values in the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls.","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"extradata":"MT","nodes":[{"content":"The EditorZoneBase class is a specialized zone class that inherits from the &lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone&gt;

There are several other types of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> classes; for more information, see the overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class. Like other tool zones, EditorZoneBase zones are not visible when a page is in normal browse mode; they are visible only when a page is in edit display mode. Also like the other tool zones, EditorZoneBase zones can only contain the special type of controls they were designed to contain (in this case, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls).  \\n  \\n The EditorZoneBase zones provide a special UI for the editing controls they contain. Many of these UI elements are common to all zones in the Web Parts control set. For a detailed discussion of the common UI elements in Web Parts zones, see the class overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class.  \\n  \\n Because the EditorZoneBase class is abstract, you cannot use it directly on a Web page. Instead, you must use a control that inherits from the EditorZoneBase class and implements its behavior. You can either use the derived zone that is provided in the Web Parts control set, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control, or you can derive your own custom EditorZoneBase control.  \\n  \\n The EditorZoneBase class provides a common user interface (UI) to contain special controls that enable end users to edit the properties, layout, appearance, and other attributes of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Some properties that apply to the UI refer to verbs, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.ApplyVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CancelVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OKVerb%2A> properties. Verbs are common actions carried out by users on a page, and are represented in the UI by buttons, links, menu items, or other elements. For example, when users edit properties on a control they can click an apply verb to save the changes.  \\n  \\n Several other properties affect text that is displayed at various points in the editing UI. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.ErrorText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.HeaderText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.InstructionText%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n Two important properties provide references to related controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorParts%2A> property is a collection of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.WebPartToEdit%2A> property is an object reference to a control contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>--which might be a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control or any other ASP.NET server control, user control, or custom control currently being edited.  \\n  \\n Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorPartChrome%2A> property references an instance of an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartChrome> object that is associated with the zone, and that contains style characteristics of the peripheral UI elements (known as chrome) such as title and border styles for <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone.  \\n  \\n A number of the methods of the EditorZoneBase class are specialized to handle the editing of other controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.Close%2A> method changes the page from the edit display mode back to a normal browsing view. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorPartChrome%2A> method is for creating the chrome (peripheral UI elements such as a border, verbs, icons, and a title) that surrounds each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorParts%2A> method is an abstract method; derived classes override it to create instances of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.InvalidateEditorParts%2A> method can be called by a derived class if the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone changes for some programmatic reason, which flags the Web Parts control set to recreate and update the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OnDisplayModeChanged%2A> method is used to set the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to `null` when the display mode changes from edit mode back to browse mode. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OnSelectedWebPartChanged%2A> method is used for handling the event when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is either entering or leaving edit mode. For example, this method is a convenient place to synchronize the property values of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control with the editable values in the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates several declarative and programmatic uses of the EditorZoneBase class. Because the class is abstract, the code examples use the derived <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class that ships with the Web Parts control set, demonstrating the properties and methods that it inherits from the EditorZoneBase class.  \\n  \\n The code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on the Web page.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that contains an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control.  \\n  \\n-   A custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class that demonstrates some of the EditorZoneBase class members.  \\n  \\n-   A description of how the example works in a browser.  \\n  \\n The source code for the user control comes from another topic. For this code example to work, you need to obtain the .ascx file for the user control from the [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) topic, and place the file in the same folder as the .aspx page in this code example.  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example is a Web page that contains a declarative reference to an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control. Near the top of the page is a `Register` directive for the user control. The user control tag is declared in the page with a `<uc1:DisplayModeMenu>` element. Notice that below the `<asp:WebPartZone>` element is an `<asp:EditorZone>` element that contains <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls, and has a variety of tags and properties set to determine its appearance and behavior. Most of the code in the page demonstrates the various programmatic uses of the EditorZoneBase properties and methods.  \\n  \\n [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_377_1.aspx)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_377_1.aspx)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class that shows how to work with a number of the EditorZoneBase class members. The custom class derives from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> so that it can be used with a zone template in the declarative markup of the Web page. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses dynamic compilation; thus, you will notice that the `Register` directive near the top of the Web page does not reference an assembly file. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#12](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_377_2.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#12](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_377_2.cs)]  \\n  \\n When you load the page in a browser, you can select **Edit Mode** from the drop-down list to switch to edit mode. You can click the verbs menu (the downward arrow) in the title bar of one of the two controls, and click **Edit** to edit the control.
