The structure is returned by the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.IExtensibleDataObject.ExtensionData%2A> property of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.IExtensibleDataObject> interface.\n  example:\n  - \"The following code serializes an instance of a type (`PersonVersion2`) that is the second version of the serializable type (`Person`). The second version contains extra data (`ID` field) that is not present in the first version. The code then deserializes the XML document into a `Person` object, then immediately reserializes the object including the extra data. Finally, the code deserializes the new XML into a `PersonVersion2` object and writes the complete data to the console, proving that the data has made a round trip to and from an older version of the type. Note that the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute must be applied with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.Name%2A> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.Namespace%2A> properties set to the same name and namespace as the original class.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[IUnknownSerializationData#0](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.runtime.seriali_10_1.vb)]\\n [!code-cs[IUnknownSerializationData#0](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.runtime.seriali_10_1.cs)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public sealed class ExtensionDataObject\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers: []\n  platform:\n  - net462\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: System.Object\n"}
